The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lbyesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, butShearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year'sbuoyant levels, which should ease current tightness. Output reductions by producers will take effect later thisyear but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere. Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually inbalance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports fromSocialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).

Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid. The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks.

Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg atmidsession. Reuter

It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires. The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals. Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this. The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB'saverage price of 104 stg. Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said qualitypotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been payingbetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesserquality grades have traded below 100 stg. Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be deliveredagainst the April futures contract between now and the end ofthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market. Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the managementcommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpracticeand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation. Reuter

The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months. The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGDand the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment onthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets. The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets. On credits that are refinanced an original lender wouldreceive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mlnstg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions. REUTER

One trader said some West African producers are annoyed theBuffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by theInternational Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have beentaken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first weekhe bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of thelimitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa sayproducers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices sofar, noting producing countries are part of the internationalcocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have togain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day averageindicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or referenceprice). However, little progress has been made in that direction,and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lowerintervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will bemaking purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of theagreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock managerare not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sourcesthere saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with theintermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against totalpotential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.Carryover holdings from the previous International CocoaAgreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne fromFriday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent fromthe market, prices go up, while when he declares his intentionto buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said. Reuter

Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said. But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added. ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise. He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" hesaid. But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors. Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out. U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. REUTER"

He declined to say if hefavoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels. May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billionstg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention. In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg. Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have beenplaying a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitmentstoward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris. ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added. Asked which techniques were available to preservestability, Lawson said both central bank intervention andinterest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the marketpressures there are from time to time."" ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in thatsense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added. Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" bydraining excess sterling liquidity from the market through newissues of government securities and foreign currency sales,when the market allowed. This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,he said. ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Notnecessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawsonsaid.

He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.

And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds. ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans. ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product."" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. REUTER"

Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inchsurface choke. ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled. ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well. ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could berecovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on theanalysts' reserve estimates. They said that without furtherresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would notdisclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercialand developed, there would be a ready local market for theheavy crude it produced. ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils andthe price differentials between heavy and light crudes are alot narrower today,"" Osborne said.

An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending. ""In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""Withthe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said. ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales,"" Temperton said. ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added. ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER"

The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again. This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added. Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas. Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes. Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said. British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K. The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factoriesnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during thecampaign. As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had beenharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather hasseverely restricted beet lifting. Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yetavailable. Reuter
