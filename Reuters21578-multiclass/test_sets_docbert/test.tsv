They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might betheir gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes. ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>. ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;JamesCapel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports. ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter,"" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergencymeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MakotoKuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade andIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in aneffort to end the dispute.

MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energysupplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600mln, they said. The decision follows the emergence of structural changes inJapanese industry following the rise in the value of the yenand a decline in domestic electric power demand. MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demandoutlook through deliberations of committee meetings of theAgency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said. They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energysupply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas. Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric powerin the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) andliquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

Thailand's improved business climate thisyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materialsand semi-finished products. The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in thefirst quarter due to lower oil prices. The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6billion baht from 56.6 billion. Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.

Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said. Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despitemaking recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that itcould possibly increase its international market share. Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oilafter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensuresupplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan. Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporaryshortage than to lose export markets. Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bankfigures. REUTER

He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading inpalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered. Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubberphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week. ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five aretraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. Nodecisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as theworld's second largest producer of natural rubber, shouldexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development ofthe exchange would help this.

Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition. ""We'll be back in position in first place within threeyears,"" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves. ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other. ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities. ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.  The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary. ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years,"" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" saidKleinwort's Smithson. ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong."" REUTER"

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buyback securities pledged on May 6. Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday's allocation. A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system. Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks. The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity. Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too muchliquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt theeffectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its mainopen-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Twofurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.

Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.

He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus ""at a proper level."" But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won. The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985. Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years. ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said. Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs. Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime. South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia. ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said. Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986. ""The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" hesaid. Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States. ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level,"" Kim said. REUTER"

The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said. The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C. The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said. The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead. Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added. Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said. Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.

High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States. ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said. ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't toomany other countries where you'd want to put your money."" The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?"" But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said. ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tougheconomic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said. ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes offthe yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought. ""They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added. REUTER"

Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens. Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before. This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986. Factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence. But sentiment received a much-needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced. The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default. The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system. Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies. There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under. The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not. Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil. Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say. Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah. But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products. Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude. Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady. External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf. Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year. But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say. In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars. This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall. Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next. ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer isimportant."" Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy. He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June. REUTER"

Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said. The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year. Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters. The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said. The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output. The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said. In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks. They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.

A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC'soutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB. Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares. Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB'splans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach offiduciary duties."" The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company's board. De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company's board. On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends. De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1. In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties. De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kongsubsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's boardmeeting. An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15.

""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added. A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial."" Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen. The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares whichare available to foreign buyers. SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB. The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit."" He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home. ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments. ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid. ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues,"" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar's value could overshoot.

Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province ofFlevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up anagenda and procedures for meetings between the employers andunions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies. Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 inprotest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the4,000-strong workforce this year. The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV onMarch 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunctionagainst the redundancies on procedural grounds. The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 butZeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against theemployers and they were therefore very likely to restart thecomplicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future. Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreementin the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenanceworkers on strike, although loading was not affected, aspokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in thesector, said.

Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements. The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear. Reuter"

Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded. ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start,"" he said. Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes. This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced. Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar. Reuter"

They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy. ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones."" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers. ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern. ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products. ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth. Reuter"

Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.

Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.

The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors."" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them. ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said. ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry. ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make,"" she said. ""You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast,"" Gormley said.  She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.

Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington. J.P.

Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days ofmeetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, MichaelSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade."" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan'ssemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injuredthe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which hascomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressivetrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan'sinaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which lastyear reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning toadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposalsbut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan'sdecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated senseof MITI's power to control Japanese traders. ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. Tostabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted byexcess inventories since 1985 will take some time."" He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enoughin trying to sell in the Japanese market. Reuter"

Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985. Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters. The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total. Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders. Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said. Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year. Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures. ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.  Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.  He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there. Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales. On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities. To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said. Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said. Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced. But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney. Reuter"

The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.  ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collandersaid in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets. ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street."" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter"

""This is just typical,"" said George Thompson ofPrudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to comehere. American Brands had to make an acquisition becausetobacco is still a significant part of earnings.

In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-releasedhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements. ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,"" Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect. ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,"" Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP. ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem. A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said. Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said. In order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said. REUTER"

MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control ofa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,they said. ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control ofa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""said one diplomatic source. ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic sourcesaid. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid. ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how toface the situation."" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's cartelephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates. ""What has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" saidJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia AdvisoryService Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst DarrellWhitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former PrimeMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, theanalysts said. ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanakafaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importanceof MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western worldincluding Britain, several analysts said. ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep orderin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonableview,"" he said.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates. Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however. Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation. But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate. It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired.

The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range. ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement."" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability. ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment. ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source toldReuters, ""This is a political process which takes time."" Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patentremedy?"" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.

Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterdaythat rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth fromspeculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state centralbank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lowerlimit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact. Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said. Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotmentthis week dashed some hopes of lower rates. The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday innew liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired. But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels. The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday. Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates. The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself. Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds. Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.This should then flow back into the market as it is depositedwith banks. Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday. Holdings of average daily reserves over the first sevendays of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above theestimated 51 billion required for all of April. REUTER

Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washingtonfor the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips itimports into the U.S. The EC Executive Commission said today the EuropeanElectrical Component Manufacturers Association complained thatJapanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasableprogrammable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices. Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROMmarket, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had beenforced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct inorder to compete with the Japanese. The Commission said it believed the Association had givensufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant aninvestigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it foundthe complaints were justified. The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privilegedaccess to the Japanese market. REUTER

Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred. Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business. Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks. Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss. In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities. AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances. This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders. AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague. In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat. Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits. AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp. AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.  REUTER

The managing director of the International Monetary Fundalso participated in the meeting. 2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment tothe cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,and noted the progress achieved in implementing theundertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement. They agreed, however, that further actions will beessential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustainglobal economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances. In this connection they welcomed the proposals justannounced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japanfor extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan'seconomy through early implementation of a large supplementarybudget exceeding those of previous years, as well asunprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures. The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to furtheropen up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services. 3.

At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed. The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid. He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable. Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental. ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said. The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within therange agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said. It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointinga level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,Miyazawa said. Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in thestatement, he said Japan was exceptional among the sevenbecause the yen appreciated against the dollar while othermajor currencies largely have been stable. He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party hasjusted adoped a package to reflate the economy while othernations are not supposed to produce new measures in a shortperiod since the Paris agreement. Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanesesemiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7meeting and did not affect the currency talks.

""Is that it? I was expecting something more than that,"" saidone trader at a major Wall Street securities company. Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: ""Themarket now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."" The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the daysjust before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlyingbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meetingof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top sevenindustrialized nations in Washington. After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued acommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement'sview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistentwith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stabilityshould be fostered around these levels. The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading. ""They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line withfundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in linewhen it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?,"" askedRepublic's Cohen. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelledspeculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities areprepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level isstill inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February. Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that thekey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of theauthorities' permissible range. Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline wouldprobably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to propup the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open marketintervention and public comments. Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank ofJapan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts ofdollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen. The sources said the market may also be wary of agressivelyselling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Tradedata. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billiondlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January."

""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thelong term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement."" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.

""Much is going better than the impression gained by thepublic from the January figures, which have been in themeantime superseded,"" he said. German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after adecline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9pct after they had been unchanged in December. Bank economists said that the two together showed theeconomy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarterof 1987. Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, asteady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/markrate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl OttoPoehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMFmeeting. Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rateson repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchasetender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the centralbank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14days, this is hardly probable."" Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had movedaway from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one oftargetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have nocomment on the subject while negotiations were still inprogress in Washington.

Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy. But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today. And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks. ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings. West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years. Reuter"

For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect."" The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.""REUTER^M"

He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said. High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said. Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987. To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986. Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987. These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations. He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling. Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year. However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance. REUTER

Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added. London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower. This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed. The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid. The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe. Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks. In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeksfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks. And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market. Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said. On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March. Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said. On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands. Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments. But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries. Labour negotiations in North America will play an importantpart in determining the direction of prices, with contractsexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter. Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contractexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view ofstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months. Traders said LME three months delivery, already attractingspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on currentfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premiumto 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg atmidsession. Reuter

The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision. One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit."" VW said in a statement following today's supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany. VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed. VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice. Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders. VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares. The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks. REUTER"

Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament. ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk,"" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States."" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit. ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year,"" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant."" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing,"" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires. The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals. Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this. The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB'saverage price of 104 stg. Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said qualitypotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been payingbetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesserquality grades have traded below 100 stg. Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be deliveredagainst the April futures contract between now and the end ofthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market. Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the managementcommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpracticeand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation. Reuter

But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits. ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already.""

""There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey've come a long way,"" he said. ""We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit,"" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lotdepends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's salescome from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market's given them creditfor,"" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. ""I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,""he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. ""But there are more positives thannegatives,"" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.  Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year. ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham. Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.  In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears. ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market,"" said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent. ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.  J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct. Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."" ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of BearStearns. Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."" Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year. ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.

The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to theEC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ECveterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban. The outbreak in the country's main ranching province hasalready led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia tobar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairyindustry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in exportrevenue. ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normallywhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension ofbeef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.  Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on theseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee thendecides on three options, allowing us to continue exportingbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspensionon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We arestill awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to beidentified. Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules. Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef salescould fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said. Reuter"

Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland'sDonegan.

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters. ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said. The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter"

In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth. USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates. All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said. Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said. USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed. The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill,"" USDA said. Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently. USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnesgrain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheatand 12 mln tonnes coarse grain. Reuter"

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977. ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990. ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts."" He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies. Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today."" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic. ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures,"" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for movingbeyond rhetoric to action."" He said they provide ""more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination."" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options."" He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives. ""If we are to take effective remedial action when there aresignificant deviations from an intended course, then we musthave more definitive ways of indentifying the right course forkey variables,"" he said.

Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets. ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident."" ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be. ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand. At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick. The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher. Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. Reuter"

Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings. ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders. ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November. ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan ofDean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously. Reuter"

For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."" ""There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."" Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit. But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar. ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit. ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year. But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put onyour helmets,"" Giordano said. REUTER"

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER

The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,the company said. ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCOregrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar caneafter April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week. Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteenmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cookingoil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumerprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwinghundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work. At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up toreceive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed awarehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound(45-kg) bags of sugar.

He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed anadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers. Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvaliertwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar. He said the government then began importing refined sugarat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit andthe provisional military-civilian government that replacedDuvalier last year continued the policy. ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't competewith smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said. HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably abovethe usual minimum wage of three dlrs. It is generally estimated that every employed Haitiansupports at least six people.

The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.

The board suspended offerings last week but because of itsurgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long itcould sustain, the sources added. Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have beenwaiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has hadtrouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to theKenyan port of Mombasa. Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis byholding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings fromcoffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said. The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee moneyand President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penaltyfor such delays, it added. Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was thatcommercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in thecurrent coffee year, while the government had asked for 100billion. The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct ofannual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment. The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows islikely to more than offset an expected increase in production. CMB officials have forecast that because the government hasrestored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda willproduce over three mln bags of coffee in the year endingSeptember 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell. Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said. About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said. Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible. In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.

Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts.

Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added.

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. REUTER"

Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out. REUTER

""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets,"" he said in a statement. Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available. If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production,"" Condon said. ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry,"" he added.

Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added. Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain. ""We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""Pex said. ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years,"" Pex added. Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.

The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year. Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth. The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly lessfavourable"" than those of the other three. The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said. The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year. The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."" They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."" They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable."" These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring. However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar. Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986. The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase. They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct. All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000. These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion. The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline."" The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986. They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986. The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct. REUTER"

Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans tosell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation forabout a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposeda takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of thestock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakupvalues for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range andspeculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed theMerrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender theirshares. The board received opinions on the offer from itsadvisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co. James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transactionwith Borg-Warner.

Merrill Lynch said that following discussions withcommercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of thefinancing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued inthe merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin payingcash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's optionfor the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.

The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturingindustry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7pct fall in February. The Department said the year-on-year rise in producerprices in March was a provisional 3.7 pct, compared with aprovisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.

The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6. The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and Marchwas mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricitycosts and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, theDepartment said.

The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2pct rise between February and March. Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct inMarch after a 2.8 pct drop in February. REUTER

Gross nationalproduct grew 2.4 pct last year. But the report said all the institutes believed that ""moremust be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additionaljobs can be created."" The institutes said any step which improved basic economicconditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From thispoint of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should bebrought forward."" The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billionmarks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief fromthe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks. However, the institutes criticised the government, not onlyfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question ofits financing had been left open. The government has not specified how the remaining 19billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies. The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn hadcaused uncertainty among companies and households as to whatexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged aquick decision from the government. They also said the government should reduce taxpreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged arestriction of state spending and called for no increase invalue-added tax. The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasingsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged. They referred specifically to a doubling of specialwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described thisas an increase in subsidies. The institutes said total subsidies, including taxpreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risenfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, itshould be possible ""despite ...

The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months. The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February. But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear. He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct. Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs. Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected. Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.

Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that themarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severelydisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of thepolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way toreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurunderscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that theAmericans want a weaker dollar."" West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thedollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now alreadya tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."" But there were signs too, that while policymakers fearedthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little theycould do until the economic picture changed, and currenciessettled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week'ssemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higherU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapiddescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit. ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy."" And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said. Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."" But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine. ""The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,"" Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism. West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement."" Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week'sstatement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes. European monetarysources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meantbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit. Reuter"

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter"

Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis.

In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer.

But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken. ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation,"" said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon. ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development. Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,""Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company's most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.

Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposingstiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japaneseexports. The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would bediscussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministerson April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepareproposals for possible retaliatory action. They said the commission has powers to take some limitedaction before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japaneseexports of electrical, photographic and other goods beingdiverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.

But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability. The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct. The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy. Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said. ""But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,"" they said. The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said. The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates. ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,"" they said. A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations. The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account. Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability. The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark. REUTER"

USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said. The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said. In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said. The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis. The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and rollactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided uponlast week and will be effective today, he said. Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.

Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct. This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds. Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrsfrom 26.2 mln. Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said. The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, comparedwith 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs atquarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.

""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than Ihave been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst StephenSmith. ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added. At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers wasrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook thanhe has been for nearly a year. ""Although the worldwide economic situation remainsunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higherfirst-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about theprospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said. ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith. A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframecomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expectedfirst-quarter results, analysts said. ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong inMarch,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil ofWashington-based Weil and Associates. Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly calledthe Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""REUTER...^M"

Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock. ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances. ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days,"" said Henderson. ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly. ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,"" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare. ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" saidRose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."" ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rosesaid. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the yearprovided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive willrequire foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ECinspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requestingthe Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mlndlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changesin their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffingto use of wood. Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approvedwithout further review. USDA would have to certify that theplants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential ofshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require moresignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures beforefurther EC review. Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American MeatInstitute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formaltrade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draftpetition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office saidU.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time.""

In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again. ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid ""if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements. ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""said Jones of Lanston. ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point."" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end. ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.   Reuter"

The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition inits final ruling on the matter. Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the CommerceDepartment's final ruling of March 9, and activates ananti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigatorsaid. The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports haveinjured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had alreadyruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decisionlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said. Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty. Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons ofBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said. Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallontariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said. An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its finalreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22. Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order andtransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entriesdating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessingduties, Vastagh said. He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,including three major shippers, would be affected by thedecision. Reuter

""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""Yates told Reuters in an interview. The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings. Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said. The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984. The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Courtruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies. ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into anavalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity."" He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Eltonsaid. It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, andAtlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards. The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates todaysaid, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying. They had cancelled last week."" He declined to identify the company. &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oilcompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, alsohalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said. But he added that Texaco expected to meet with theVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that keysupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with theAlgerians, he added. Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the company's business. ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said MartinKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyerand Traub. ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said.

Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day. TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify. Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum."" ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont&lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd. David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own. Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talkswith Dome. Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment. Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfullyoptimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share. Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""he said. Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome."" The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand. ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""Gobert said. Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas. The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealermanager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed. But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct. The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock. The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp. Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase&#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow. ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991,"" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986. ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said. The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.

The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs andquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, andsheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, theysaid. ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said ChristopherChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food pricestwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of theaverage household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the grossnational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added. ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. ""All that money could be spent on something else."" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said. ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said.

Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct inJanuary/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a yearearlier, it said. The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase infloating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shiftto private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billionyen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to theeffects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices workingtheir way out of the index. The February increase was less thanJanauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average forthe later months of 1986. Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations inJanuary was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year.  Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still ninepct lower than a year earlier, it said. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct inFebruary, in line with previous months, although there has beensome acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain. Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumerprice inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed byCanada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, theU.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative ratesof 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.

But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets. ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said. U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said. ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said. Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases. A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice. Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed. He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said. U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports. Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry. The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certainminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals. REUTER"

The plan will also urge the government to double 1985'sofficial development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within fiveyears instead of seven as the government had promised, seniorLDP officials said at a press conference. LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explainthe plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19. Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month. Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of thetax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abewill be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials. The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods bythe government will probably include the purchase of supercomputers, LDP officials said. According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solvespecific trade problems with other nations and will encourageflows of funds to developing countries, the officials said. The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy andlessen trade problems with the U.S., They added. The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to andwelcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrialnations in Washington last week, they said. The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of severalpackages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will beunveiled by the government in late May. REUTER

The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan byLyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade. However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan wasalready the world's largest grain importer. Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain anddepended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its foodrequirements in 1985. Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farmproducts named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as onbeef, citrus products and rice. Kato said Japan will maintain its current level ofself-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus ricebecause potential production is higher than domestic demand. The world farm market suffers from surpluses because ofrising production by exporting countries, he added. Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm productoutput with expensive programs, Maki said. Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussionson each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talksat a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade RepresentativeClayton Yeutter will join.

The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities."" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action."" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation. U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan wouldretaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war withthe United States. Reuter"

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its AmocoCanada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp. Reuter

But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern."" He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regretthat these actions are necessary,"" but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets. ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara. He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japanabided by the agreement. U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that healready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade. The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn'tdone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair tradepractice."" The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was anexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fightunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a majoroverall of our trade laws."" But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was notin the best interests of the United States, and thatnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue. ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" hesaid, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions intrade."" Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for itspolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impacton Congress."" He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense."" But other analysts said it made little difference whetherthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,and that the main point was that the trading partners were onnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use. Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but theimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act whenit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so. ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."" Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms. ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said. ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,"" the study said. ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. REUTER"

It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in thepast, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses intailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced atotal of 2.1 mln ounces. City Resources also said previous dredging was only carriedout to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values arereported to at least 60 metres in the central part of theBulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.

""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview. He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether. ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root."" He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop. ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid. With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said. ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output. ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said. ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land. ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said. PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry. Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land. REUTER"

Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago,"" he said. He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels. The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output. ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said. A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said. ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained,"" he said. Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control. He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer.""

The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984. This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87. ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said. Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said. He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said. The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said. Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said. It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87. Reuter

The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp&lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 sharesof super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corpand the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan. The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf ofHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as asubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pctconvertible debentures. The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds bymore than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available fordividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulentconveyance. The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclosethat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which itterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable torepay it. Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share tostockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced anextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimedat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing. British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of therecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing itsalternatives. British Printing said it filed the suit after consultationwith its advisers.

British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormousincrease effective on the June eight record date for thedividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable uponconversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convertdenbentures before the record date because Harcourt may nothave enough authorized common shares to honor conversion afterthe date. British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrsworth of debentures.

But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stockingand lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow thegroup to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter. ""On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy adegree of stability rarely seen in recent years,"" it said. It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly butonly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota. The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signalson the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed inDecember when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adoptsthe provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room foroverproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crudewill probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said. It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotasin Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refusedto honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemyIran. But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realisessomething must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said. According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has alreadyheld separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to bemore moderate. ""One strong indication that some kind of deal may beeventually worked out is the almost complete silence comingfrom Iran,"" it said. Indications are that, in return for going along with theSaudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran isseeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, itsaid. Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphilltask in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987. Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to opposesuch a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press foranother price rise if the dollar remains weak against othercurrencies. Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlierthan it intended to ward off growing calls for higher pricesfrom the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration. The report concluded that there is a strong possibilityofficial OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988. REUTER&#3;"

The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGDand the Bank of England. Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment onthe plan. However, bankers said one of the main points underdiscussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's mediumterm credit portfolio in the international capital markets. The proposals involve introducing a set of interest marginson ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the sizeand maturity of the credit and the currency. The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankerssaid that while these rates would reduce a bank's return theywould still be more than those proposed about a year ago whenthe government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate anothercost reduction plan. At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow theECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existinggovernment backed credit in the capital markets.

Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth. ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct. Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct inthe money market. REUTER"

Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in thenearby contracts amid quiet trading today.

""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette. ""But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front,"" he said. Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter"

One trader said some West African producers are annoyed theBuffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by theInternational Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have beentaken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first weekhe bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of thelimitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa sayproducers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices sofar, noting producing countries are part of the internationalcocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have togain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day averageindicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or referenceprice). However, little progress has been made in that direction,and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lowerintervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will bemaking purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of theagreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock managerare not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sourcesthere saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with theintermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against totalpotential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.Carryover holdings from the previous International CocoaAgreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne fromFriday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent fromthe market, prices go up, while when he declares his intentionto buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said. Reuter

""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. ""The market has not approached the old price limits andtrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said. On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the twocontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copperand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,which were severely tested by a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the liftingof all daily limits, effective today. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs perounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in thenearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said. Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most backmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearbycontracts amid quiet trading today. During the last week of April, silver futures often tradedat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, thedollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, orunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, manyunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders. The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrsfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets. O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits wouldadd caution to trading. ""This is a more realistic approach because the metalsmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""O'Neill said. Reuter"

Traders said the new market would probably be a usefultrading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tininterests although European traders generally appear to bereasonably satisfied with the current ""free market"" systemwhich has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tintrading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want tosee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market andwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries. There is also a view among European traders that, while theproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide anotheruseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysiangovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times bythe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable. Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption oftrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that whilethere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subjecta definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Courtlitigation actions have been resolved. Spot tin prices on the European free market are currentlyaround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouseRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a tenyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as4,680 stg in December 1986. This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME tradingceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year. LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485tonnes reached in February 1986. Traders said the free market turned bullish during latelast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demanddeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predictingprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987. However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswingin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December. The decline accelerated as producers who had sold verylittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers. There was also a lack of significant demand from majorsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year. Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tinholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,and the bulk of material still available is being held byMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress themarket with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after theInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager haltedsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 membersnations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by brokerShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reportedhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tinposition. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tinprices and movements are still expected to be largely relatedto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demandemerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has madeefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher worldprices by attempting to bring all major producers under anexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, twomajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument andapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts toconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five daysbut that will depend on when the water level of the Red Riverrecedes. There is already evidence that the water level isdropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the areaaffecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away.    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has notfound any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,which is nearby. Reuter"

The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine. Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.

USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it. Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share. At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said. Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said.

The transportationand energy company would both gain entry into a profitablebusiness and win cost-control benefits, he said. ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairlysignficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.

Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"" ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace.""

Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton. ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company,"" said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. Reuter"

""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp. Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances. On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen. ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's. Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as ""impressive"". James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen."" Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."" Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure. Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives. President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten."" ""The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe. Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action. Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan."" Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.

The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, haseffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela'svolatile currency market. The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos HernandezDelfino, manager of the bank's department of internationaloperations. The telex said the restriction on business with foreignbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreignexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreigncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela. In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has deniedrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls toprop up the weakening bolivar. But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a defacto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sensethat there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one brokerhere said. ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the directionis towards complete control,"" the broker said. The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all hisVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him sincethe central bank issued the telex and followed it up withtelephone calls. He said that before the restriction was imposed the volumeof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrsa day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" hesaid. The broker said he saw no logical explanation for theprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediarybetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks. ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that'sridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage againstforeigners."" The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's centralbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchangebusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pctreserve requirement. In February, the central bank also prohibited trading inbolivar futures, the broker said. ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a smallcurrency it was miraculous."" He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current rangeof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly runningout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the freemarket.

With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed. The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter,"" he said in an interview. Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy. Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct. He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample. Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to sixpct target. He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply. ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,"" Schlesinger said. A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,"" Schlesinger said. The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said. Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances. At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks. ""Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""Schelsinger said. ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase."" He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see."" ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said. The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year. Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said. Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation. The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said. But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it."" REUTER"

They said the relaxation of controls was now under reviewby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI). A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bringabout a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freercompetition, we have no choice but to accept it."" The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12. The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI itshould end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. Itshould cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct ofcurrent capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput andgasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished. They said deregulation was vital to promote morecompetition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable. ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turnto see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a sourceat one major Japanese oil company. A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hardtime surviving, but that's something we must go through."" ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs forthe oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching outfurther into other lines such as real estate and travelagencies,"" he said. Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltdwhich had the largest share of refined products sales in theJapanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refiningcapacity in fiscal 1986. Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil productsin 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, aspokesman for the company said. Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of theCouncil, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companieswithin seven refining and marketing groups to improve theefficiency of the industry. Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely tobe streamlined further into five refining groups. ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups tomerge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said. A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out thepossibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industryin the event of the relaxation of oil controls.

But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines ofcommunication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to takea broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministrysaid Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran andIraq, which have been at war since September 1980. Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financialhelp to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan'scrude oil passes through the waterway. President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes inthe Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agendafor next week's G-7 summit in Venice. Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step upits naval presence in the Gulf despite congressionalexpressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to helpmaintain freedom of navigation. Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from beingdeployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washingtonunderstands this problem. REUTER

The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pctand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarterfrom a year earlier. ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it(growth) short,"" Fernandez said.  NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in thefourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNPgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct. ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said. ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear,"" he said. Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter. He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986. ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said. He said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon. The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July orAugust to review performance in the January-June period. He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years. ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said. It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMFdebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said. The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March. Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started inOctober last year, had almost been completed. He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said. Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""Ithink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable."" The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987. NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs. Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved. Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports morecompetitive. ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the country'strading partners,"" he said. On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the Code. The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups. ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after theevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to beprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the windsand I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said. ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement ofcapital and earnings can be free,"" he said. ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainlywe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our externalavailabilities simply by servicing our debts."" REUTER"

The official said there had been a delay in gatheringinformation for the data, which are expected to show that theWest German economy contracted in the period. A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said therewas no political motivation behind publishing the figures onJune 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends. ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technicalmatter,"" he added. The West German government is expected to come underpressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partnersto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing internationaltrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth. However, government officials have ruled out any furthertax reduction packages to supplement a major program ofstimulatory fiscal measures already underway. Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, thewidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in realterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the firstquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.  The government has confirmed that growth was negative inthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected tobe about two pct. Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance tocut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,at three pct, is just above historical lows. West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venicesummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,is already outstripping export performance, which has sufferedfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just overtwo years. The government has pointed out that depressed exports arethe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, butsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand willcompensate for this setback. It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just undertwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986. REUTER"

President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say. (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA) But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany's business community. The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank. There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982. Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up. Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980. In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century. But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate. ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently. Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy. ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy,"" she said. An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply."" One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies. The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact. ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator's position worthless. Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career. A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker. He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf. Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced. ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers ofmany people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit. REUTER"

""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over thelast 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue tobe extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, becausefarmers could earn more from other crops and because technicaland seed improvements had not been widely disseminated. The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a yearearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year. The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlierfigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New ChinaNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure. The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong provincefell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that thearea under sugar was dropping. ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspapersaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation ofnearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of caneis a major problem."" A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop inarea planted. He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were weldeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to themaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar. The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast provinceof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only70 from one mu of sugarbeet. The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980. Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competedwith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted infalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills. The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, theofficial press has said. Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes ofsugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985. The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mlntonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier. A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocksin 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to importsugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986when the central government resumed control of imports. ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was storedin Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomatsaid. The trader said transporting stocks from these areas toconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularlyas coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar isone factor determining import levels,"" he said. Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,China's major supplier through barter trade, he said. ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyernow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go intothe open market."" A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regardingimports was price. ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.

It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullahwaterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at thehead of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.

The central bank's statement added that the measure wouldbe effective until the end of July. Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow offoreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. Theyadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plungeof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lendforeign exchange to importers and exporters. Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banksreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,according to official statistics. Last week the central bank said that from today it wouldreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the movewas needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchangemarket. Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbankmarket to avoid exchange rate losses. Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in Mayreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9billion in April. All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be convertedinto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of boomingexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct inthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions onremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals toTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money. Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value ofthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It hasflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S.. Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about22 pct against the U.S. Dollar. Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise theforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs oncapital outflows. The central bank has said the controls willbe dropped by the end of July or early August.

Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out. U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in. REUTER"

Faced with competing demands for increased military andpolice spending and the pressing need for more funds for blackhousing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis isexpected to raise significantly the government's overallexpenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,the analysts said. Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in statespending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for thefinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleasfrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes. ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct. Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct. Economists estimate that the government's spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP. The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said. ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview. Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets. South African Mutual's Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF. ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years. The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985. Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective. But private-sector economists caution that the government'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country's balance of payments. Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks. Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre. Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely. Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-onlyelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget. ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented HarrySchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal ProgressiveFederal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all thesweets were given out before the election."" REUTER"

Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said. ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto."" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord. ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.Budget deficit was ""very important."" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."" ""There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified,"" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japanbashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions. ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would bediscussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have topush further."" REUTER"

ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposedbid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said. ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target."" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.

Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, nationalproduction would be around two pct higher than in the previousseason at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said. If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achievedin 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, anincrease of 11 pct compared to 1986. Reuter

Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industriesand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chickenhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neitherthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of anincrease in outbreaks of the disease. May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed thatbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of allU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pctof outbreaks and dairy products six pct. May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads andmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods. May said the chicken industry favored moving away frombird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment systembetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contaminationof poultry. However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice forFood and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should beretained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cookchicken to remind consumers about preparation proceduresnecessary to avoid illness.

Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said. They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations. Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said. Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid. This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely highprices, he added. Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a majorcrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled. REUTER

The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash."" Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann. Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But Idon't expect any convincing measures,"" he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the European CurrencyUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of theSaarland bordering France, and was twice under Frenchoccupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes.

The stance taken by the experts backs up the officialposition of the West German government ahead of next week'sseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to bepressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy. West German government officials have stressed Bonn is notin a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts duenext year and 1990 are already stretching the budget. The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in officialinterest rates although it sees market rates continuing low. The experts' prediction for economic growth this year ofbetween 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from aforecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast. Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The governmentitself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986. REUTER"

But there was no hint what the announcement might be.

But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact. reuter

The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago. ""While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While theindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic marketsthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our researchindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company wasexamining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. He declined to name the companies but said a deal couldoccur as soon as the second half of 1987.    Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer inthe U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian ChemicalsCo, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tiresamong other products. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify andeventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copperoperations. Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrsto buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.    Any acquisition candidate would have to have a differenteconomic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and goodmanagement, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendlydeal, he added. ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services orabout a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basicindustrial company that will fit into our managementstructure,"" Durham said.    During the interview, Durham and other executives also saidcontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead tohigher prices for the metal. ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice presidentDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost ofproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest andcorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990. Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound nowcompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analystssaid. Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have beenfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong. He declined to project results for the second quarter oryear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise incopper prices in the last month will help results. Durham said last month that the second quarter should matchthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mlndlrs or 49 cts a share. First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increasedcopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, alsoacquired last year.

The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirdsof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an allianceof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought todefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislatorsoppose President Reagan's policies in the region. The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships. The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf. It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy. The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature. Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only afirst step toward a greater congressional involvement informulating policy.

The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall. The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure. Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.

Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.    ""Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff. ""The international community will not like thisappointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.  Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges,"" Horner said.

Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 cropindicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)crop year. The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced486,790 tonnes. For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayedharvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from theGovernor-general to demands following the May 14 coup. Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would makea payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment forthe 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growersfor commencement of harvesting would be completed at all millsby June 23. Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said. The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is thefull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceedsreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October. Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery tothe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlledFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said. However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of theforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all caneharvested by November 30, he said. Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance ofthe expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. Thebalance of the second payment will be made six weeks after theend of crushing."" Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that anestimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.The FDB rejected this request. Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefullyconsider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases ofhardship on a case-by-case basis."" In response to a further demand that all soldiers beremoved from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the armywould restrict its presence in the cane areas. He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits toharvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unionsto hold the necessary meetings in preparation for thecommencement of harvest. Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers hadindicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,he added. REUTER"

The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House. The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said. The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters. Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs. House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal. But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims. Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn. However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail. Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity. Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains. Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said. Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986. This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities. Reuter

""All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a ""package."" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna. ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said. REUTER"

Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplusfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrsagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surpluswas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reutersbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond andthe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despitelower interest rates, as overseas investors became moreconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said. However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, sayingthe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and willmove lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in afterhours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budgetrelease. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the sharemarket, despite an increase in the contribution of companytaxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplusannouncement could push the share market up by 50 pointstomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with acontinuation of existing policies, and the absence oftraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positivelyby overseas investors, another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-taxavoidance measures could damage some sectors of the sharemarket, particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. Therequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mlnN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable andthere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, anothereconomist said. He added that the document seemed entirelycredible. ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""he said. An election is due before the end of September. REUTER"

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak."" The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming. The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money. Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers. Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar. The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity. However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive. He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""

The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.

It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said. ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued.""

He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.

Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billiondlrs. Reuter"

Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy."" The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said. Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill""agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement. The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added. Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid. Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level. He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime. ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said. Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules. It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats. EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said. The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said. The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said. It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said. Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

The company was appealing against a decision of the TaxCommissioners that any such provision was a capitalexpenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.The court was told that since 1976 the company had made anannual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost ofabandoning a rig.

He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.  Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said. The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said. The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said. He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990. Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.  The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm. At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said. Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season. The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said. World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth. Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.

But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a toughInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program hasintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructurethe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said. Copper production by the government-controlled ZambiaConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial yearended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from arecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes. ""We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financialyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes dueto greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a ZCCMofficial said. ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, anotherstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand. Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonneshigher than the previous year and the best production achievedto date. Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copperindustry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Miningis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountry's foreign exchange earnings. Production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes. A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the AfricanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank. The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable. ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan. More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan. Company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production. Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level beinglevied, a net loss is likely to be registered. ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 comparedwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before. Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose asthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just overtwo to the dollar. But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished theauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economicstrategy based on national resources. ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects thebreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans. ""We are still consulting to see how the new measures willaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fareunder the new situation,"" Peter Hansen, director of operationsand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters. Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchangerate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's exportprofits. ""Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-evenpoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,"" FrederickChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said. High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambianindustry. Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United Statesand under 40 cents in Chile. The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambiabeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it hadstopped sBending copper south through South Africa. Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, aresent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares andfuel.

Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year. As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said. Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" headded. Reuter"

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.  In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said. ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.

Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment. ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share."" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and RalstonPurina Co &lt;RAL>. ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said aWall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now,"" hesaid.    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has tobe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued byshareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time. According to a copy of Perelman's letter released byGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive mergeragreement without any financing condition. He said CitibankN.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financialadviser. Reuter"

This would be done by seeking agreement among majorexporting countries including the European Community on marketsharing at agreed high prices. Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearingthat such a grain export cartel is not workable. -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supportswould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food pricesstem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than fromhigh farm product prices.

He said as a transition to the higher prices, he wouldallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.grain stocks for three years. Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said. -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farmparticipation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the currentfarm program.

But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast aslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Lastyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growingeconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct. The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988. The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around fivepct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround inimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labourcosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the reportsaid. This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demandshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumptionmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations. Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration inItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports andadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988.

But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,""thus weakening the international adjustment process."" It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs. The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports. The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth. The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year. Reuter"

The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Instituteof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on crossborder trade would benefit both countries. But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'generally harmonious trade relations are probably notsustainable without a new agreement."" The United States and Canada, whose cross-border tradetotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holdingtalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriersremaining between their two countries. The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but bothsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargainingremained. Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade tiescould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure onPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, andthis could hit some Canadian trade practices. He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its autoindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateralfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts. Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable toa resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.exports to Canada. A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada andenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, whichwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said. It would also increase the gross national products of bothcountries. Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end alltariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rulesfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on governmentprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

""Employment is forecast todecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in theprivate sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.

It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion. ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars,"" it said. While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect. The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last. In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth. Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to beheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumerprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct nextyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986. ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factorsbehind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.

""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets. But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."" This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said. The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries. Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact. He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP. The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986. There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear.

But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy. A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said. ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth. Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges. If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said. ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."" Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs. But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached. A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said. ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point,"" he said. Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease."" Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy. They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth. But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said. REUTER"

Suhudsaid. The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raisedits share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yenin government loans to the company for an equity stake. The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas EconomicCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen. Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yendebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciationof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold indollars. Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago toabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even ifprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne. Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes ayear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan. REUTER

Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters thereserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past twoweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against theU.S. Dollar. Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is muchslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surpluswith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.Dlrs a month between January and May. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs. On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings oflocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bankpurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90pct of the value of a contract. Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures haddrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange toimporters and exporters. They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollartransactions showed a drastic decline with some banksregistering a fall of up to 30 pct. Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised againstthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanesecents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of fiveto eight cents in May. The bank dealers said the central bank, which hadpreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercialdemand. They said they expected the government to keep the localdollar stable in the near term to give breathing space tobusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise ofmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar sinceSeptember 1985. The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,unchanged from yesterday. Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflowis quite successful."" Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slowerrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure fromWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan. Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayedimports of machinery and production equipment because ofexchange rate uncertainty, he said.

Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billionyen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia'sinvestment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct. The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest anadditional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment nowtotals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51pct, the official said. The sources said the rescue programs for the two projectswere larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire tohelp develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and tostabilise sources of aluminium.

He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to letthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exportedtin lapse on June 3. The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct thismonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lowerlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aidthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985. Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet alarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100tonnes per day. As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated bythe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the yearending February 1988. Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC toallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said. The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a MineralResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes latethis month, Yoot said.

Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, asOPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapturetheir share of the market. In the process, prices collapsedfrom about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until theorganisation decided to cut production again from lastSeptember onwards.

Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightlyto 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on theofficial Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in thenumber of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985. Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year.

And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money. The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business. While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago. But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts. As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds. ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages. The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore. Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said. The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans. ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans. But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product."" Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year. The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman. ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume. In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets. But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money. Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director. Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument. But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably. However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor. For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years. REUTER"

They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing. ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output. ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil. ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" hesaid. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts. ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said. Reuter"

The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said. The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.

Van Horick, who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting. The new formula is based on six-year moving averages andwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement, van Horick said. If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement, van Horick said. Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster inBrazil. Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction. ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposalleaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said. ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone."" Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said. Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota. ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, "" van Horick said. At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude. ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we mightjust get an agreement,"" van Horick added. Reuter"

Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes. He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea. Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports. ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said. Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year. The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September. ""Not enough research and development effort has been put inby tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutessuch as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said. He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as anexciting possible new application. Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra moneywhich needed to be spent on research into new uses before thenew paper was produced. He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamentalbarriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new InternationalRubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accordinto some EC languages are still being awaited. Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia'sbehalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said itwas important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" betweenthe old agreement lapsing in October and the new one cominginto force.

He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollarand the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by atrade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."" Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after twodays of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now inCongress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs. Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly atJapan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,annual trade surpluses with the United States. Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nationswith large trade surpluses last year with the United States,but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs. The European Community has also opposed the bills. Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed theReagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections inthe legislation, including those to curb imports and to requireretaliation for foreign unfair trade practices. He told reporters the committee would likely mount acampaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debateon the Senate floor, expected next week. Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continuedevelopment.  We hope this need will not be affected negativelyby trade legislation.""

According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudsonmanagement has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed tothe group buying its stock the company's desire to remainindependent. Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governorRudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help. A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governoris expected later today to recommend stiffening the state'santi-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defenditself. Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislatorswould probably look at language similar to that contained inIndiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed wouldprobably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling acompany for its own profit.   ""Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes wehave would not protect them enough,"" Vanasek said. Reuter"

David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

The new system will add such items as fiber optics and moreaccurately define new composites, items not widely traded whenthe current schedule was devised some 30 years ago. Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face."" He said the new system ended 12 years of multinationalnegotiations to create the unified tariff schedule. Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making. He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards underthe new system, with about half expected to join the system byJanuary 1988. reuter"

Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent. ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says. ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession,"" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve. ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.

""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger thanexpected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" sucha trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said. September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level. ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar,"" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refundingauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the resultswith little excitement. However, a successful auction couldprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing marketpsychology. Reuter"

The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, wouldprobably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Hellesaid. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies andwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts. OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 andretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accordbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point. OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, andit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarterceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourthquarter. Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshorefields, previously said it would continue its output curbs fromplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remainedwithin its December accord on output and prices. Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mlnbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995. The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented sinceFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd. Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland fora meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statementon the latest oil production cutbacks. Over the past year several other leading non-OPECproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysiaand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keepprices stable. Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following anOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December. Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total exportearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil priceduring the first half of 1986.

The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks. Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid. Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86. Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added. London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It describedearly development of the new main crop as patchy. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this yearforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coastdue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimatedthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's4.33 mln bag harvest. Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffeecrop as ""normal."" REUTER"

They said the American decision inevitably carries somerisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its bluntrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington. ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into theGulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat. Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attackson ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected byAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf. The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oiltankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is ratedby diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that theIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said. Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."" The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri topatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escortingKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registeredto fly the American flag to give them naval protection. Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack byIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq. Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed byChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran ispreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz. The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely tomake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said. A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up alaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in theFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait. ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaititerritory would be a very serious escalation"" likely movingworld opinion against Iran, remarked one. Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carryingout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf. Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predictedlast Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the eventof any U.S. strike against Iran. Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accusedof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrablecapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself. Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now thatmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked topro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potentialtrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets. Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage orother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added. Reuter"

In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter

The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasurysaid in a two-sentence announcement. The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiationsbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the pasteight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesmansaid. The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said. Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most havematurities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, thespokesman said. He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have anadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the generaldecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinanceat lower interest rates. However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be facedwith lower yields. Reuter

The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area. ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government."" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980. In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadershiphad adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic andcharitable activities. Reuter"

Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inchsurface choke. ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters. He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct. Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled. ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said. Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well. ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could berecovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters. However, Chevron officials declined to comment on theanalysts' reserve estimates. They said that without furtherresearch and drilling in the area this summer, they would notdisclose any reserve figures. Analysts said that if the field were declared commercialand developed, there would be a ready local market for theheavy crude it produced. ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils andthe price differentials between heavy and light crudes are alot narrower today,"" Osborne said.

Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerceseminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's totalexports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billiondlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total. ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reachfive billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn tofunction in the American marketplace and place greater emphasison product quality,"" Yaacobi said. While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis Europeancurrencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trendtoward higher U.S. exports. In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rosefivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, whileimports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year. Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pctannually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.  He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passedlast year and eliminating all duties and other commercialrestrictions between the two nations through 1994, wouldcontinue to facilitate the desired export growth. Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act asan economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentageof the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa. Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middleeast was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been ableto achieve its economic potential. Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs inaid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financingmilitary conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said. Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economicindependence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption thatexports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

There has been grain industry speculation that the USDAwill offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the nextmarketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultationswere held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made. ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summeror before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said. Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about nextyear's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. Itwould be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""

Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales inAsia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitablefor European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders thatlarge tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesiaand Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoaprices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was consideredunsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and ahigh level of free fatty acids. Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and theUnited States if it did not produce a type suitable for WesternEurope.

The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry officialwho wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problemwith quality and would continue to expand sales. He describedcriticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant itdid not have any difficulty with exports. Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodityproducers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside theInternational Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Officials have said Malaysian production is expected tototal 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because ofthe end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largestcocoa growing area. Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output isprojected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnesthis year as young trees mature. Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers andtraders said they could last out low prices longer than WestAfrican countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices wouldhave to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) tomake cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic. Some traders believe the main quality problem is withharvesting and fermentation techniques.

He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Militaryaction in the Gulf. But in an address to a conference of the IndonesianPetroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and saythe flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completelyshut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,can take care of the situation."" ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a shortduration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage ofthe situation,"" he declared. Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relativelyshort-term impact on prices, he added. Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spotprices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likelyhover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs perbarrel. ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greaterthan the downward ones."" ""The balance between supply and demand in the short termwill still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may stillgo up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increasein world demand."" Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee whichhas been touring cartel members, said speculation may playhavoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize thesituation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers. In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach aplateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, hesaid. REUTER"

""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurredhere and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,""Poehl told an investment conference. ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interestin higher capital market rates,"" he said. Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced atender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80pct. Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate haveseen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pctat last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender inlate September. The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injectionsof money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct. These moves to cap interest rates followed a meetingbetween Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt. Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmedtheir commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability. Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening inWest German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of thedollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended. But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting innervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday. Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was notdue to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, andcurrency developments. Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""Youhave to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue apolicy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, hesaid. Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution tointernational cooperation in interest and monetary policy. The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its moneysupply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said. ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interestrates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said. This had to be taken into account when considering recentrises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due torising international money market rates that had spilled overinto the German market, he said. Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so farignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits. ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance isdefinitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not sonoticeable in absolute figures. The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had alsoattracted little attention, he said. REUTER"

A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said. Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.  Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said. But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said. Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase. A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need tosupport the stock and security markets,"" he said. But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week. Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago. With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said. ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won'tbe that big,"" said another. Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last year'seconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said. Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said. In deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said. ""That will at least take acouple of days, if not weeks,"" he said. REUTER"

Iranian officials have said theirresponse would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interestsaround the world might come under attack. Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulfaggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region'soil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attacksignificantly affecting oil prices.

""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" oneanalyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said. ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" aU.S. Customs spokesman said. ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),"" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system. ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.  ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands."" Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled. According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans. ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term. ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of athreat,"" one trader said.

EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops.

""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey ofHoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in theU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world."" But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits. ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson. ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates,"" he added. Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind. ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel'sDennis. But he added that markets are still very much indanger. ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing isdisappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted. David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said worldmarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,as implied by West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currenciesis still on. Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered byexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the moneysupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currencystability. But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, saidMorrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. Tostabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said. Reuter"

An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending. ""In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities. Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout. U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out. Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""Withthe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said. ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury. But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct. It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending. Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets. Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said. In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales,"" Temperton said. ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added. ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said. A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending. Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing. Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Muchof the rise reflected quarterly interest payments. REUTER"

Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project. Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets. Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year. Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth. The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, whichpumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said. Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.

The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic.

Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference onTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanismfor cereal substitutes. He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with theDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chairmeetings of their EC colleagues. Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would helpthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stabilityfor producers. This would in turn help the market position for certaincrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peasand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severeoutput restrictions. A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats taxon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fatssucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ECprice fixing. However, the EC Commission has said it maintains itsproposals for a tax. Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursueinternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim ofbridging the gap between EC and world prices. Reuter

ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps."" ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962,"" he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax. The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adamssaid.

Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association. He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee. The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC. The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said. Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said. Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic. The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week. The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies. The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said. Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then. ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said. The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added. The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said. If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added. Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.  ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon. But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point."" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday. ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington."" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar. REUTER"

Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation. Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq toldjournalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)concessions were not enough."" ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.

U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a ""measured andappropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf. ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire. ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's anychance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf. ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities,"" Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any futuremajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at BandarAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining theapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.

""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" aBank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition. ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""Alpert said. ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analystsaid. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal. ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer willlook good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry. ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed,"" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobberedmore than the acquirees,"" another analyst said. Reuter"

Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""Histiming could not have been worse."" One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship."" However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand. ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York. ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,"" he said. After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview. In many ways, the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was ""puzzled."" U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact. For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't dothat."" Reuter"

President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods. U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliancewith the agreement earlier this week. The periodic reviews are to continue and the remainingsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan isin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement. reuter

He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set backworldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them. The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguayto liberalize the global trading system and to include in ittrade in agriculture and services such as banking. Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meetingmarking the second year of their bilateral accord. TheCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yetbeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually removetariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods andmany services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts ""other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT."" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe."" He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living."" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."" Reuter"

News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in greatsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism byBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fearsthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy. The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit. West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises. ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here. ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London. The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said. Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility. The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.

One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday. The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel andconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it. The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained. U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines. But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the deathof one thousand cuts."" But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement. Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for theoutbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-styleinfantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties. Each side has attacked the others' shipping. Reuter"

U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday thatU.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulfin response to a missile strike on the American-registeredKuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate. Iran had warned the United States earlier in the dayagainst exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military actionwould endanger American interests. Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's WarInformation Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a""crushing blow."" ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can inno way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoidostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman onNovember 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently inDamascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help inpreventing a total Arab breach with Tehran. Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arabstates could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, theysaid. ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran torespond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said. President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger Americancountermeasures if the military escalation continued. Western diplomats and military sources in the area saidshelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative actthe United States could have taken once it had decided toretaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americansand Kuwaitis on Iran. ""It's interesting that they chose something in internationalwaters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" onediplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the GulfArab states, particularly Kuwait."" Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that theU.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attackedon its doorstep.""

A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the placethey chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastatedanything because it wasn't working in the first place.""

The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and islikely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict aslong as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launchinglimited retaliatory strikes. But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, ordestroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as thecycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS). ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carrollof Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)think tank. Some Middle East experts say the only way out is forWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end tothe war between Iran and Iraq. They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy beganescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, whichPresident Reagan could never accept. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagonnews conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoelfired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostamoil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulftime (0700 EDT) on Monday. Weinberger said the platform had been used as a militarybase by Iran and that the attack responded to an IranianSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker SeaIsle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance andallowed to escape. ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we willbe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iranwith stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said. ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservativesagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did notescalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question waswhether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not takenthis view after earlier clashes. Reuter"

Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year."" ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.    In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month. USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said. Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said. While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest. A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes. Reuter"

""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst withstockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPECproduction in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mlnbpd, little changed from September levels. Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPECproduction could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter andInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC Septemberproduction at 18.5 mln bpd. The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said. Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""aresponsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating toIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iranchose to raise the level of conflict. Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation. The initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missilelaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said. The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navyattack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence SecretaryCaspar Weinburger. Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in theGulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it lessserious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,analysts and traders said.

But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock andbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrialcountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-terminterest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He wasreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Groupof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact. Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.Agreed to stop talking the dollar down. However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvreagreement was still operative, the West German interest ratemove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord. ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker thathe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all betsare off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currencyanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said. But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguineview, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparentlyreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Bakercomment will regret it later on."" French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted theLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers torespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit."" Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row. But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord."" In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executiveof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said thatfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.Was still committed to the accord. In a move which the market interpreted as a possiblegesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-termliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct onMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injectedmedium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France alsostepped into the French money market to hold down rates,injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates roseclose to eight pct. Reuter"

The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again. This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added. Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas. Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes. Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said. British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K. The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factoriesnormally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during thecampaign. As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had beenharvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather hasseverely restricted beet lifting. Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yetavailable. Reuter

Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services. He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986. Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets. ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year. However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,"" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year. Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy. Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spendingnext year on medical services, education, pensions and socialinsurance schemes. Reuter"

Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pctagainst a planned 4.1 pct this year. He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.

Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineeringindustry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedas a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if theSoviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of thisyear against the same period of 1986. This is well below the7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.

""Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,"" he said.

Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week. Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs. This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar. The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier. ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said. The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth. More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September. The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom. If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplusseemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the UnitedStates which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit withSeoul last year, government economists said. The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressureat home, has called on South Korea to open more markets toAmerican goods and revalue the won faster.

Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane andbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on SaudiArabian LPG, the sources said. They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader. Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia. No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said. ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area,"" said another trader. Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports. Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said. They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments. Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991. Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said. The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said. But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said. Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said. The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice. Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light. Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight's GSP. Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said. Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement. Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume. ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" saidan official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments."" Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier,"" said one. REUTER"

But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over acontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes ofthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said. Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors. ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified. Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time. ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister. News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad. Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market. Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately. Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability. In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices. Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said. ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank'sPfister. ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,"" said another economist. The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters. The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October. Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases. Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports. One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990. But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for. The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts. The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks. But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in. Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal. Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party. The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections. Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide. Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again. But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said. REUTER"

And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews. ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters. The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted. A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen. The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen. ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said. He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem. Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said. Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S. ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid. Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates. The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said. But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said. Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets. The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination. The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said. The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.

""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up wellfrom a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored inproper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in atelephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber soldsince he entered the market in September would be discussed atan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said. Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest inbuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possiblepoor quality. Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO'sfive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stockwas uppermost in consumers' minds. ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understandthe Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubberbefore they carry on buying,"" he said. Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 differentlocations in producing and consuming nations, adding allwarehouses used were suitable for long-term storage. Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during thepast week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and seeattitude"" by buyers, he said. ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amountsuntil they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reducethe offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interestbut INRO did not want to depress prices artificially. Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimatesthat he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpurand New York since September. But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have anidea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overallhad put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes. The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonnebuffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Councilmeeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday. The current international rubber pact expires on October22. The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 andHofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber duringthe interim period.

Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said. Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies. The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast. Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said. He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation. The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added. New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June. The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit. ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

Sendi alsotold reporters he had negotiated a 69.7 mln French franc loanfrom the Banque Industrielle d'Afrique Oriental in Paris. Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, andexpects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year. Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefitUganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under thelatest International Coffee Agreement. In addition, the value of roasted coffee should besubstantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.

""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here. The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10. The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said. ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying. The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said. Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation. Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand. West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said. U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said. ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment. The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said. ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""Hirabayashi said.

Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period. Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct. Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given. One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality. Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard. Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period. The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures. The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis. Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986. But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period. Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year.
