They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products. But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might betheir gain. The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost. Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes. ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>. ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;JamesCapel and Co>. In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried. ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named. Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S. The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest. ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>. A senior official of South Korea's trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan. Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S. In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports. ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry. ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said. The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports. The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday. ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between twocountries which are major trading partners of ours is a veryserious matter,"" Button said. He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significantU.S. Exports to that country. Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve thetrade stand-off continue. Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlineda package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy. The measures proposed include a large supplementary budgetand record public works spending in the first half of thefinancial year. They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergencymeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MakotoKuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade andIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in aneffort to end the dispute.

Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober. But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition. ""We'll be back in position in first place within threeyears,"" Komatsu said in an interview. He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak. But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off. Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch. The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves. ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson. Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co. Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other. ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst. But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time. ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said. Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home. Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking. But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities. ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."" Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said. He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.  The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct. But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary. ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years,"" he said. Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added. The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo. ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" saidKleinwort's Smithson. ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong."" REUTER"

""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said. Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector. ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid. REUTER"

He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus ""at a proper level."" But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won. The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985. Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years. ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said. Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs. Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime. South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia. ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said. Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986. ""The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" hesaid. Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States. ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level,"" Kim said. REUTER"

The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said. The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C. The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said. The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead. Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added. Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said. Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia. The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said. REUTER

High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States. ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said. ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't toomany other countries where you'd want to put your money."" The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?"" But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said. ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tougheconomic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said. ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes offthe yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought. ""They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added. REUTER"

In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit."" He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home. ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments. ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid. ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on thepart of our American colleagues,"" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction ofthe dollar's value could overshoot.

Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil. That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986. Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities. Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket. On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln. Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln. Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct. If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added. After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier. It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier. Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier.

Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days ofmeetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, MichaelSmith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart. The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments. They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,including television and audio equipment and computers. Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments. President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement. In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade."" Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan'ssemiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injuredthe U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which hascomplained about presidential timidity on trade issues. Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressivetrade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan'sinaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which lastyear reached 169.8 billion dlrs. About one-third of the deficit was with Japan. Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning toadhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it. Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposalsbut did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation. He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan'sdecision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated senseof MITI's power to control Japanese traders. ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. Tostabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted byexcess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""

The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs. Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.  ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst. ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collandersaid in an interview. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar. The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger. Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit. In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels. As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit. The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending. ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates. Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession. Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none. But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets. ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters. The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems. The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end. In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget. On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law. While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs. ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."" Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels. ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street."" The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year. The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts. Reuter"

MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control ofa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,they said. ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control ofa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""said one diplomatic source. ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic sourcesaid. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid. ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how toface the situation."" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's cartelephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates. ""What has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" saidJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia AdvisoryService Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst DarrellWhitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former PrimeMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, theanalysts said. ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanakafaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importanceof MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western worldincluding Britain, several analysts said. ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep orderin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonableview,"" he said.

But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today. And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks. ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings. West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years. Reuter"

Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene ""as and whennecessary."" He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday. Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament. ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk,"" he said. Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States."" Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit. ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year,"" Lawson said. The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention. Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."" Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant."" He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing,"" he said. Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement. Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand. They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.

They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates. The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure. The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly. They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements. They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other. The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies. Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said. In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid. Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said. This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies. At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries didnot want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they didnot object to the yen strengthening, they said. REUTER

However, Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue tradetalks with the United States despite its failure to convinceAmerica to call off the threatened tariffs during two days ofemergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday. Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions inretaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in marketsoutside the United States and to open its home market toAmerican goods.

Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington. ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,"" he said. He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct. The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei. Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.

Taiwan's 1986 trade surpluswith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada. Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. REUTER"

Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC. However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan. Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17. The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S. The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February. In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs. In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine. Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan. Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract. However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened. By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan. The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas. At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars. EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount. They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action. One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out. REUTER

Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo saythey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currenciesare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japanshrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar downmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast ofworld trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollarfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Fivepact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pctmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of themeconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan risingrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declinedonly 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widelyinterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollarmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials canonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.

Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that themarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severelydisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of thepolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way toreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurunderscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that theAmericans want a weaker dollar."" West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thedollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now alreadya tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,leading to a renewed rise in interest rates."" But there were signs too, that while policymakers fearedthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little theycould do until the economic picture changed, and currenciessettled into a stable pattern as a result. Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week'ssemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higherU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapiddescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession. Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit. ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said. Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy."" And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said. Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system."" But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens. U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine. ""The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,"" Baker told the meetings. Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels. Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism. West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn. Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget. The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher. The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement."" Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week'sstatement read. Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes. European monetarysources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meantbusiness with its commitment to cut the budget deficit. Reuter"

Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire. Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan. Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations. TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto. Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt. ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary. TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said. The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added. ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said. Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said. Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said. Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's. Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings. However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer. Reuter"

Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington. ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,"" he said.

The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added. Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner. Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.

The Commerce Department had alreadyruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decisionlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said. The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.

The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case. ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,"" Elton said.

Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.

Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct. However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""he said.

TransCanada would not detail the profit level. Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand. ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""Gobert said.

Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase&#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings. Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports. He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow. ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991,"" he added. Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986. ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said. The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae. South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs. The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said. ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said. Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value,"" he said. He said the South Korean won would be revalued against thedollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shotchanges in the value of the won.""

The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs andquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, andsheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, theysaid. ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said ChristopherChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co. The ultimate cost of the existing system is food pricestwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,The analysts said. Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of theaverage household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the grossnational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew. Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added. ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. ""All that money could be spent on something else."" Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted. Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said. ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University. Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference. External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan. But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said. Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders. The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said. Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said. Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said. Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew. REUTER"

""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said. Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases. A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice. Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed. He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said. U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports. Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry. The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.

The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film. The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing. In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities."" He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products. U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action."" Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion. About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan. Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices. He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices. Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation. The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up. U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports. Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT). It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation.

Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs toretaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to enddumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less thancost and to open its home markets to U.S. products. Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United Statesdid not want to terminate the agreement and would dropthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.

But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern."" He said it left the United States open to retaliation. The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed. In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""to other nations on the need for fair trade practices. Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said. Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit. The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would. The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit. But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all. Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regretthat these actions are necessary,"" but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets. ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.

The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf ofHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as asubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pctconvertible debentures.

But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stockingand lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow thegroup to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter. ""On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy adegree of stability rarely seen in recent years,"" it said. It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly butonly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota. The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signalson the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed inDecember when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adoptsthe provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room foroverproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crudewill probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said. It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotasin Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refusedto honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemyIran. But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realisessomething must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said. According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has alreadyheld separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to bemore moderate. ""One strong indication that some kind of deal may beeventually worked out is the almost complete silence comingfrom Iran,"" it said. Indications are that, in return for going along with theSaudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran isseeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, itsaid. Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphilltask in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987. Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to opposesuch a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press foranother price rise if the dollar remains weak against othercurrencies. Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlierthan it intended to ward off growing calls for higher pricesfrom the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration. The report concluded that there is a strong possibilityofficial OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988. REUTER&#3;"

However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswingin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.

Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tinholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,and the bulk of material still available is being held byMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress themarket with unwanted metal. Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after theInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager haltedsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 membersnations of the International Tin Agreement. The overhang of metal was reduced further by brokerShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reportedhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tinposition. Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tinprices and movements are still expected to be largely relatedto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demandemerges for the third quarter. The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has madeefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher worldprices by attempting to bring all major producers under anexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, twomajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument andapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts toconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said. ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates. Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years."" He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate. Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto."" Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord. ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.Budget deficit was ""very important."" Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical."" ""There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified,"" he said. Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japanbashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years. Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said. He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth. In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries. On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice. The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year. Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank. He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions. ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said. U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions. He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would bediscussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have topush further."" REUTER"

But there was no hint what the announcement might be. Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact. But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10. The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit. Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods. The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools. Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact. reuter

But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the newsconference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Mightdecide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions onsome Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied: ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of anagreement that had been reached between the United States andJapan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chipmarket. ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to theagreement that it made become evident.""

Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies totake action to stimulate the world economy without a boldAmerican initiative to reduce the size of the federal budgetdeficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle theproblem.

U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrsannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as highas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas wereremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of theattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation said at a press conference today. Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through theAgriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan waslaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April. ""The promising Japanese beef market could be one of thebright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,"" said Philip Seng,Asian Director for the Federation. ""We supply and they (Japan)buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want tobuy more,"" he said. Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limitstotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expandingU.S. beef shipments to Japan. The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall. The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure. Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota. High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected markethas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industryofficials said. Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrsfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat associationsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrsper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb. Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beefper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,officials said. Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and adecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mlntonnes. Reuter"

They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive. There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices. But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity. ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered."" Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales. Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a ""package."" Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers. OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months. Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say. The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out. Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products. Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent. In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen. Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel. But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna. ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said. REUTER"

The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to risinginflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third worlddebt problem to increase the risks of a world economicdownturn. ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets. But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."" This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said. The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries. Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact. He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP. The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986. There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear. The OECD called for efforts to liberalize worldagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away fromprice guarantees and other measures linked to productiontowards direct income support for farmers.

The organisation's latest half-yearly report says GrossDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pctin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will behelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demandfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added. The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumerprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988. The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightlyand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growthforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct. The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economicgrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which isstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis. The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,should again show growth over the next two years, rising by0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988. Reuter

In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plantpopulation is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainyweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects arerated as slightly below normal. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool withheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth. In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, itwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall whichcontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field workimpossible.

They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf. The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986. OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review. Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises. Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing. ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures. OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter. This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December. Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output. ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy. ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild. However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions. Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation. Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil. ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" hesaid. One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war. ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites. Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts. ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisislike this, and just general nervousness over an incident thatcould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said. Reuter"

The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said. The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.

""A joint venture opens up the potential for penetratingmarkets that would not otherwise be possible (for China),""Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said. An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue SouthKorean markets. Indirect trade between China and Seoul isgrowing but is not officially publicised. Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project, which isintended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminiumsmelter. CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs inPortland. The China-based joint venture would process Portlandaluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domesticChinese market as well as for export, Jolly said. The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22mln dlrs, but Aluvic would have the right to appoint keymanagers, he said. Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generatedby their participation would lead to further CITIC investmentin Victoria.

Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales inAsia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitablefor European tastes. They were responding to comments by London traders thatlarge tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesiaand Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoaprices. London traders said the Asian cocoa was consideredunsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and ahigh level of free fatty acids.

Officials have said Malaysian production is expected tototal 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987. This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because ofthe end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largestcocoa growing area.

Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers andtraders said they could last out low prices longer than WestAfrican countries. According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices wouldhave to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) tomake cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.

""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturatedanimal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systemsleaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,"" he said. U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued thatsaturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels woulddiscourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favourof domestic unsaturated alternatives.

""If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten.

""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts. Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say. Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.

Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem. The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession. It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind. ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel'sDennis.

He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee. The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC. The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said. Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said. Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic. The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week. The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies. The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said. Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then. ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said. The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added. The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said. If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added. Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.  ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon. But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point."" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday. ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington."" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar. REUTER"

Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.

U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a ""measured andappropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters. Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf. ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said. He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack. In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack. Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire. ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's anychance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf. ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities,"" Cordesman said. He predicted the United States would respond to any futuremajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at BandarAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining theapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.

Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""Histiming could not have been worse."" One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship."" However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand. ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York. ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,"" he said. After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview. In many ways, the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was ""puzzled."" U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact. For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap.

President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods. The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers. Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs. Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers. The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors. They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month. The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.

Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meetingmarking the second year of their bilateral accord. TheCanadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yetbeen approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament. The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually removetariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods andmany services. Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts ""other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT."" The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries. Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT. Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe."" He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living."" Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism. He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade. The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising. Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade. Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto. He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained."" Reuter"

News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in greatsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism byBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fearsthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy. The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit. West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises. ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here. ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London. The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said. Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility. The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week. Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvreaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue. The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left WestGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visitDenmark and Belgium. Reuter"

But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the deathof one thousand cuts."" But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.

Weinberger said the platform had been used as a militarybase by Iran and that the attack responded to an IranianSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker SeaIsle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance andallowed to escape. ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we willbe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iranwith stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said. ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservativesagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did notescalate the conflict unduly.

The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war. The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile. Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said. They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said. Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said. But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible. Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response. ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.

Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however. He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation.

And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews. ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters. The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted. A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen. The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen. ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said. He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem. Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said. Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S. ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid. Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates. The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said. But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said. Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets. The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination. The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said. The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said. He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher. ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not takingpolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal raterise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" headded. REUTER"

""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here. The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10. The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said. ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying. The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said. Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation. Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand. West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said. U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said. ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment. The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said. ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as lowas 135 yen soon. REUTER"
