Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses. ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said. Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said. In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC. Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts. Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days. His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer. To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced. The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers. Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said. He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements. The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover. ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it,"" Proxmire said. Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment. He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills. Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later thismonth and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring. He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill thisyear. Reuter"

This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy. ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones."" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers. ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern. ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products. ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth. Reuter"

The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake. A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors."" Burlington said it did not know if the report was true. Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play. Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S. Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition. A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them. ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon. Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said. ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry. ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make,"" she said. ""You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast,"" Gormley said.  She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share. Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels. Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis. Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share. ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager. Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company. Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc. The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington. J.P.

For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern. The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985. In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said. For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year. The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt. IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade. Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth. Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries. Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports. The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF. For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success. The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit. Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected. The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect."" The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.""REUTER^M"

But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits. ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already.""

""There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient. Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround. Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey've come a long way,"" he said. ""We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said. Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year. Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid. Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit,"" he said. The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lotdepends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's salescome from oil and natural gas. Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market's given them creditfor,"" she said. She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts ashare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in1986. Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, hasbeen recommending the stocks since last November. Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the groupalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through thethird quarter. But he sees potential trouble beyond then. ""I think (steel)prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,""he said. Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonaldropoff later in the year. ""But there are more positives thannegatives,"" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domesticindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which shouldcause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.  Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year. Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year. ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham. Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.  In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears. ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market,"" said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent. ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.  J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct. Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest."" ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of BearStearns. Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."" Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year. ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner. Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning ofthe year. Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle ofMay.

The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters.

The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.

The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity andquality requirements on the materials, mostly metals. The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Billwhich will be voted on in the House next month. The purpose of the measures, passed by the committeeyesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discouragesell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, astaff member of the committee told Reuters. ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by beingmanaged properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpileover the last 10 years has been atrocious."" Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to aWhite House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The staffer said that under the measures passed by thecommittee the Secretary of Defense would have more influenceover decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials. The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrsworth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. Thestockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials. He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to managethe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit. These agencies included the Office of Management and Budgetand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said. The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpilemanagement was counter-productive, he said. Reuter"

Lichtblau, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Associates. Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977. ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said. Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990. ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said. He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration. Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices. ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said. Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said. A potential for alternative supplies could limit thewillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said. Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offertax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the StrategicPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plansfor alternative energy.

In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned. ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts."" He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies. Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today."" The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs. Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic. ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures,"" he said. Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for movingbeyond rhetoric to action."" He said they provide ""more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination."" He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators. ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""he said. Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options."" He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.

Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets. ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident."" ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be. ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand. At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick. The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher. Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals. Reuter"

Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings. ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders. ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November. ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan ofDean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously. Reuter"

For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."" ""There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."" Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit. But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar. ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit. ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year. But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put onyour helmets,"" Giordano said. REUTER"

Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said. But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs. Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>. Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco. Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment. Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts. Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit. ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters. Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11. Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said. Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added. Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing aconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texacotold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to goto bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.

A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares. GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share. Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans tosell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargosecurity guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation forabout a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposeda takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of thestock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakupvalues for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range andspeculated an offer would have to be sweetened. In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed theMerrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender theirshares. The board received opinions on the offer from itsadvisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co. James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transactionwith Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with theemployees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining itsstrong presence in the Chicago community.""

The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered. Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed toprovide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln insubordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments. Merrill Lynch said that following discussions withcommercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of thefinancing required to complete the transaction. The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued inthe merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin payingcash interest after five years. The debentures will be redeemable at the company's optionfor the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount. The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturityof 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing inthe 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue beforematurity. Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs pershare.

In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by hisMTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the prorationperiod will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer hadbeen scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said hehad received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to theoffer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate. Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mlncommon shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on aprimary basis. Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune. The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout. Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that theamended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares togive him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and onthe arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by NewJersey and Nevada gaming authorities. He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring allof Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by amerger transaction. Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shareshe is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis. He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number ofshares in response to his tender. In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included inthe statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing toincrease the price of his offer. Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully inplace. Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now deliveredto him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasingdividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS HoldingCorp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition. He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads asyndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlrmargin facility, believes it will be able to arrange forfurther commitments under the margin facility to advance up toan additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit thepurchase of shares under the offer. Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm. He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdharesare purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive acombination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a valueof 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."" Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior toCaesars' recapitalization. Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gamingofficials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatoryprocess required for regulatory approval, a process that italready underway in New Jersey.

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company's most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing. Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one. The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987. Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln. The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs. It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act. As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said. The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said. In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said. The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.

Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.

The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction ofincome as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual. Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly tomiddle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But someof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates. Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losseswas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986. Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at theend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrsof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status. The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual forthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reducedby about 4.9 mln dlrs.

At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs. Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year. These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July. In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses. Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F.

""Although the worldwide economic situation remainsunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higherfirst-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about theprospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said. ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.

Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill LynchCapital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance. Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8. ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming inwith another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at51 or 52 dlrs per share. GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct ofBorg-Warner's stock. ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to upthe price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you haveto. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're lookingat it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst RichardHenderson said. Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share. GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. MerrillLynch officials did not return phone calls. Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heymansought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plasticsbusiness. The rigid plastics are used in such things astelephones, computer terminals, and appliances. ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemicaloperation these days,"" said Henderson. ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and hedoes not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson. GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeoverof the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAFdid not win the company, it made a substantial gain on itsinvestment in Carbide. Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into itsBorg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock. ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst. One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly. ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,"" he said. Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service. Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare. ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" saidRose. Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."" ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rosesaid. Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton. Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the yearprovided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive willrequire foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ECinspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requestingthe Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mlndlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changesin their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffingto use of wood. Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approvedwithout further review. USDA would have to certify that theplants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential ofshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require moresignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures beforefurther EC review. Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American MeatInstitute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formaltrade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draftpetition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office saidU.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time."" However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government andmeat industry circles that the EC will continue to allowshipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, fromU.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bringtheir operations into conformity with the EC regulation, theUSTR official said.

In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again. ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid ""if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements. ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""said Jones of Lanston. ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point."" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end. ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.   Reuter"

Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series Apreferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr ashare exercise price before the merger is effective, it said. Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December. At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it wouldconsider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it saidit was told the company had decided against a buyout. But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr ashare proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said. Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warnermanagement was asked not to take part in the new deal and itwas conditioned upon payment of the fees. In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer. Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions. But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger. All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal. Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said. To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures. GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash. Reuter

""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp. Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct. Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously. Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated. However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week. First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes. As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed. Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late. Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so. ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct. After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."" Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace. Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms. ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said. The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand. Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said. ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,"" the study said. ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""the FTC study said. Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s. It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand. The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations. In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit. REUTER"

Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in thenearby contracts amid quiet trading today.

""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systemssoftware,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkinand Jenrette. ""But the combination of the two companies will clearlypresent a much stronger front,"" he said. Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away themost powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analystTerence Quinn. That field is a segment of the market known as systemutilities, or software packages that boost the productivity ofa company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,power and efficiency of large mainframe computers. The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines thetwo biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms thatwill find the competition much harder than in the past. For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps asix-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry. When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor. Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31. Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp. Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth. On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs. For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs. The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer servicesunit. Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products. In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems. Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap. Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year. Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share. Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development. Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share. Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base. Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel. The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct. In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment. Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang. Reuter"

""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. ""The market has not approached the old price limits andtrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said. On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the twocontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copperand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,which were severely tested by a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the liftingof all daily limits, effective today. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs perounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in thenearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said. Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most backmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearbycontracts amid quiet trading today. During the last week of April, silver futures often tradedat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, thedollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, orunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, manyunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders. The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrsfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets. O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits wouldadd caution to trading. ""This is a more realistic approach because the metalsmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""O'Neill said. Reuter"

""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get anydivers down to assess the damage but there is some possibilitythat the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a companysource said. The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude andone-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region. Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service isrestored by Friday there would be little problem in restoringoil which has been lost to the flood. ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will bedifficult to make up without prorationing and we would not liketo proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."" The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic RichfieldCorp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline'soperator.  Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crudeoil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose tonew highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break. July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts. Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers ofWTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel. Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipelineshutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with WestTexas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr abarrel below WTI, respectively. Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five daysbut that will depend on when the water level of the Red Riverrecedes. There is already evidence that the water level isdropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the areaaffecting the pipeline, Stevens said. He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away.    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline. Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has notfound any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,which is nearby. Reuter"

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private. Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged. The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns. ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"" ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace."" Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer. Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading.  Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares. A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer. Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television. In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profitwent to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985. Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said ina statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchaseof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc toassist in financing the balance. Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have toborrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout sinceCrazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the sameamount. Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Mondayto 9.50. Reuter"

Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York. Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction. Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 storesgenerated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners payroyalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company. Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions toComputerland. Computerland officials could not immediately bereached for comment. E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venturecapital funds, and its past investments have included MattelInc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a moneymanager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strongupturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make keychanges if it is to fend off advances from rivals likeBusinessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shackstores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,customer service and customer support,"" said Levy ofInternational Data. Relations between Computerland and its franchise ownershave mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give upmanagment control of the company in 1985.

Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company. Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker. Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman. Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided. Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer. Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.  That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company. Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said. Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements. Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary. Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information. Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton. ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company,"" said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey. Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said. Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate. Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer. Reuter"

""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp. Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances. On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen. ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's. Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as ""impressive"". James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen."" Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."" Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure. Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives. President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten."" ""The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe. Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action. Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan."" Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.

Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industriesand a director of the National Broiler Council, told a HouseAgriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chickenhas not increased in recent years and that chicken is neitherthe major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of anincrease in outbreaks of the disease. May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed thatbetween 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of allU.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pctof outbreaks and dairy products six pct. May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads andmixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods. May said the chicken industry favored moving away frombird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment systembetter able to identify microbial and bacterial contaminationof poultry.

Traders said thatbarring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect thereport to be neutral to bearish for oil prices. Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to besteady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oilprices, the analysts said. Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming importscontinue at relatively high levels. Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mlnbarrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22. Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, wholooks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasolinedemand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off tobetween 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demandwould have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added. Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a drawin stocks of about of about one mln barrels.    The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latestreport for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasolinedemand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year. But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely tofounder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated. Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and addto U.S. stocks. But some analysts said that refiners may have held refineryruns. Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel levelreported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks wasdiscounted as having a market impact at this time.

The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago. ""While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation. CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms. Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries. President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year. However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation. Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said. He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct. Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct. ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both. While theindustry may not be able to compete in all domestic marketsthat it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our researchindicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have beenfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong. He declined to project results for the second quarter oryear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise incopper prices in the last month will help results. Durham said last month that the second quarter should matchthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mlndlrs or 49 cts a share.

Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit. In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said. Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.    ""Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff. ""The international community will not like thisappointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.  Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""Horner said. A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7summit, he said. But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said. Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said. The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said. Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said. However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges,"" Horner said. Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloanesaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end oftheir 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance. For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yenfutures to advance toward the 0.007200 area.

The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House. The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said. The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters. Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs. House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal. But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims. Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn. However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail. Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity. Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains. Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said. Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986. This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities. Reuter

Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points onrumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based onabout 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy wasvaluing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said. Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statementaround mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct ofthe unit, leading investors to take profits. After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4. ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhatdisappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. Hesaid rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple ofdays."" Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn'tgetting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and itsvalue was not reflected in the company's stock price. Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein saidthe unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year andhe expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year. Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena sayschemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth aboutthree billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500to 600 mln dlrs. Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stakebecause chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated thecompany would use the proceeds to pay down debt. But he added the possibility remained the deal would fallthrough. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet beenpresented to its board. The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billiondlrs. Reuter"

But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse,"" Mohler said.

Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year. As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said. Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" headded. Reuter"

Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said. Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.  In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said. Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities. Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers. Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said. Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers. While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said. Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said. If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said. Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said. ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said. Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said. Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said. In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said. Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.

Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission. ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target. Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday. The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment. ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share."" Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions. Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette. Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and RalstonPurina Co &lt;RAL>. ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said aWall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now,"" hesaid.    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has tobe careful.

Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrsfor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans. Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world marketsharing cartel with the European Community and other exportingnations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during thefirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearingsexamining farm programs. Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his""Family Farm Act."" -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm incomeand reduce government spending on agriculture. -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would notruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but wouldincrease overall revenue from exports. This would be done by seeking agreement among majorexporting countries including the European Community on marketsharing at agreed high prices. Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearingthat such a grain export cartel is not workable. -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supportswould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food pricesstem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than fromhigh farm product prices.

He said as a transition to the higher prices, he wouldallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.grain stocks for three years. Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said. -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farmparticipation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the currentfarm program.

But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy. A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said. ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth. Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges. If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said. ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."" Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs. But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached. A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said. ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point,"" he said. Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease."" Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy. They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth. But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said. REUTER"

David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission. If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands. The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street. The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing. The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading. But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets. At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape. And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock. Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud. Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers. Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981. In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations. The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat. Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities. The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff. The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates. The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone. By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House. Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms. The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities. It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices. Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president. Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule iscalled, will change tariff categories and definitions to meetthe present-day needs of exporters and importers, but theyshould pay about the same rates of duties. Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier todeal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety ofdiffering systems which they now face.""

Yeutter said government and business moves are based ondata from tariff schedules and the new system will improveknowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.

In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers. Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell. The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access. Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.

Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say. ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official. The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report. Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent. ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters. Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages. To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says. ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""Gramley said. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia. Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative. Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession. Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists. He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar. ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession,"" Mauro said. In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve. ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said. But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986. The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said. ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit. A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker. Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world's largest debtor nation. The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.

""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said. Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term. Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy. The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively. Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger thanexpected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" sucha trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""Kahan said. Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said. Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said. September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said. While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level. ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said. The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said. ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar,"" Kahan said. Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said. In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refundingauctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the resultswith little excitement. However, a successful auction couldprove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing marketpsychology. Reuter"

In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer. Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo. On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said. Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said. Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets. The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said. Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged. Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid. DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer. The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share. The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer. But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo. In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future. Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt. Reuter

The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not. Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list. Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status. Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California. However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period. At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California. Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system. But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area. ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government."" The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity. Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm. Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac. The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.

Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out atabout 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley. The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers outof the market, he and others said. ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainlyunexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economistwith Data Resources.

""We fully expecteda decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" saidJames Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions. Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales ofexisting homes, which are generally less expensive than newhomes. Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of newcondominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast werereflected in sales of existing but not new homes. Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the marketis going to stabilize and give us a good second half."" Others were less optimistic, however. ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but Idon't think this is the start of a collapse in single-familyhousing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.

""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" oneanalyst said. On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill. Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry. While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said. ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" aU.S. Customs spokesman said. ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),"" he said. Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system. ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.  ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands."" Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled. According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans. ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko. Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term. ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of athreat,"" one trader said.

""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyngtold Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourgendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguayround agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the planseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposingcurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic. Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative todoing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. Ithink that is the unrealistic position."" ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we aretrying to say."" Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree afreeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started. ""All that some countries would like to have would be awheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range ofagricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, hesaid.

""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" aBank of New York spokesman said. Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares. Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence. In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share. At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said. According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis. Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition. ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc. ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""Alpert said. ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analystsaid. The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer. However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal. ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer willlook good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm. The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said. Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry. ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed,"" Alpert said. Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said. ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobberedmore than the acquirees,"" another analyst said. Reuter"
