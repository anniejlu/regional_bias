The federal government reported today that the monthlysurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher thanFebruary 1986's 189 mln dlr tally. ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto. Economists generally don't expect such large gains over thenext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout theyear. ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over theyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure isindicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at theToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd. Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billiondls in the month. ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value ofexports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in itsmonthly report. Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billiondlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.

The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading. Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy. They say the country's consumers, who have been spending ata torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlaysthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports intothe country. Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency. ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland'sDonegan. But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economistWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook andsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February'strade upturn. Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showingsigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicatethat part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) isprobably transitory.""

Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement. The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks. TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders. Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs. Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals. It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments."" But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals. TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said hewas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and deniedthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome'sstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision toauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announceit,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of theother bidders, or the terms of other offers. Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on theToronto Stock Exchange.

The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets. No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said. However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said. Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment. Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them. Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada. British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome. In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said. A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said. A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry. Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons. Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrsin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as heforecast in the February budget. And in the year ended this past March, the deficit wasexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said. Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal yearhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm incomesupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipatedrevenues. But finance department documents show the pace of deficitreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and thetransition to the reformed taxation system. The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs infiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1billion dlrs in 1991. Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadianeconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pctthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by anactual 3.1 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at aroundthe current four pct level over the next two years. Reuter"

The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and wasartificially developed several years ago. The plant, which hasbeen grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet inthree months and is said to produce better quality newsprintthan wood pulp, a CIP official said.  Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre butwould need partners to begin the project. ""We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions ofdollars it would take for such a project,"" Slenniken said.  He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis tomake newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pctsoftwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant. CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recentlylaunched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metrictonnes per year by fall of 1989.
