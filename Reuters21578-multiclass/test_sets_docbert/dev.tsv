""Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations byexplaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points thatneed to be corrected,"" he was quoted by Kyodo News Service assaying. While expressing regret over America's decision to imposetariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods, Nakasone saidTokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washingtonto help settle the dispute. Government officials said Japan would make a formal requestnext week for emergency talks and that the two sides wouldprobably meet the week after, just days before the April 17deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect. Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japaninvestigation of American claims that Japanese companies aredumping cut-price chips in Asian markets. Yesterday, Washington announced plans to put as much as 300mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronicgoods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure tolive up to their bilateral chip pact. That agreement, hammered out late last year after months ofheated negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-pricechips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips. Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatorythan those of his Trade and Industry Minister, Hajime Tamura,who earlier today said Japan was ready to take ""appropriatemeasures"" if Washington went ahead with the sanctions. Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura'sremark and said that his main message was that the two sidesneed to talk urgently about the issue. But they admitted that Japan was considering taking theUnited States to GATT, the Geneva-based internationalorganization which polices world trade, if Washington imposedthe tariffs. Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), theysaid. If that article were invoked, GATT would set up a panelto consider the legality of the U.S. Action. But officials here said they hope that can be avoided. ""Itmay be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the UnitedStates may lift its decision at an early date,"" Tamura said. In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday, PresidentRonald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he hadevidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in worldmarkets and had opened up its own market to imports. Japanese government officials said they are confident theycan make the pact work. They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chipsthrough unregulated distributors has all but dried up afterMITI instructed domestic makers to cut output. While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japaneseimports of American chips, MITI officials said that theministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens. The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users,some of whom are also leading producers, to step up theirpurchases of foreign semiconductors. A spokesman for one of the companies, Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T>said his firm would do just that and could announce its plansin the next week or so. He expects other Japanese companies todo likewise.

ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financialadvisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek otherpurchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value. ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its boardadopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through anymeans other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks otherpurchasers. ChemLawn also said it began litigation against WasteManagement in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive andother relief. The suit alleges, among other things, that certain WasteManagement officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stockbefore making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchasespossibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and theSecurities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules. Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquireChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs. ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offerwas inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,suppliers, creditors, and customers. ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer andconcluded that it does not fully reflect the value of thecompany. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender theirshares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen. ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protectshareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""marketaccumulations by Waste Management or others."" Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will bedistributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawncommon. ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of itscommon for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of itscommmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all itsshares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board. It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days afterthey become exercisable if later than that date.

Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflectedeconomic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflectfundamentals. Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated tobring about currency stability in line with the Parisagreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperateto that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene ifnecessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall waslikely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currencylevels would be considered in line with underlying economicfundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to holdcurrencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behindthe fall of the dollar to a record low against the yenyesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as itnervously reacted to statements abroad and to developmentssurrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekendthat the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for thedollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter calledU.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has beenmoving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate toremain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharprise of the yen. The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange ratesin line with the Paris accord, he added. REUTER

The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operationssaid that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yenon January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanesemonetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and theU.S. Treasury. The Fed's intervention was on the morning after presidentReagan's State of the Union message and was ""in a mannerconsistent with the joint statement"" made by U.S. Treasurysecretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister KiichiMiyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness tocooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed's report did not say at what level the interventionoccurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yenafter dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. Ithad closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 markson January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughoutNovember and the first half of December, the dollar movedsharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies andseven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallenfour pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollarsubsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operationand talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrialcountries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation onexchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S.interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questionsabout whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marksand 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, ithad declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen inearly November.

Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering andelectronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, areall on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State TradingCorp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). ""The two state trading corporations are free to use theirbuying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indianexports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding thatprivate firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries thatdepend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreignimports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small partof India's total trading and are likely to account for lessthan eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in tradeduring the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the EasternBloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps ofagricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crudeoil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to helpnarrow the country's large trade deficit, is stillinsignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billionin the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries incountertrade is also due to other factors, including the slowgrowth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promotingcountertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were madediscreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannotofficially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron oreexports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause thatpreference will be given to parties who accept payment in kindfor goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,adding that the policy remains flexible. ""We also take into account other factors such as prices atwhich the goods and services are offered to India,"" the tradeofficial said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreigncompanies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigsand railway equipment to India that they stood a better chanceif they bought Indian goods or services in return, the tradesources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Koreanfirm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mlndlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buyIndian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pctsought by New Delhi, the trade official said. ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,""he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreigncurrency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol tobuy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe inexchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive, countertrade has someinherent problems, they added. ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement thatthe trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""Theother problem is it is often difficult to supply or buycommodities which the other party wants."" Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon itas a temporary measure to get over the current balance ofpayments difficulty. ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."" REUTER"

The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institutemay ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by thedisease and added that most estates affected belong to theState Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.

A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25years and union leaders say they have seriously affectedBrazilian exports by making idle 160 ships. On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interestpayments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharpdeterioration in its trade balance. Today the government faced a fresh problem, when mostpetrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrialheartland, and in three other states closed down to press forhigher fuel prices. There were fears that the combination of the two stoppagescould lead to a serious fuel shortage. The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras. The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial todayentitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economicpoint of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,with grave consequences for the supply situation and for thecountry's external trade."" The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejectedoffers of up to 100 pct. Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is dueto rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a seniorofficial of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis LeaoFranco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardlessof the tribunal's ruling. Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapseover the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan pricefreeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Notonly workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol stationowners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in SaoPaulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Television reports said that in the Parana state capital ofCuritiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel forexceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions. Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise theirprofits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (sixU.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).

In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a keyHouse subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version oflegislation to require President Reagan to retaliate againstforeign countries that follow unfair trade practices. The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional effortsto restore competitiveness of American industries and turnaround last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit. Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcementof trade laws. The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly oncomplaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping productsin the United States at prices below cost of production. Italso forces the administration to act rapidly when an industrycomplains that a surge in imports threatens its existence. In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls fortrade relief for specific industries such as textiles. Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made toomany concessions to Reagan and said they intend to backamendments to ""get tough"" with countries that violate tradeagreements or keep out U.S. products. But congressmen known for their allegiance to free tradesaid the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputesand they will seek to restore his negotiating powers. Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was notone ""that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,""but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to worktoward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse. The goal of trade legislation was ""to make our trade policystronger without violating our international trade agreements,""he said. In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and MeansCommittee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the tradesubcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forcedReagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on importsfrom countries that engage in unfair trade practices. It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation ifit would hurt the U.S. economy. Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach wasnecessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would signinto law. Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a toughHouse trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year heonly reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he sawDemocratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters latelast week that the administration still did not like some ofthe bill's provisions, but he added, ""Generally we feel verygood about the bipartisan consideration of the tradelegislation. I think we are progressing very well."" The first battle will take place next week when the fullHouse Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide onlythat the existence of a large trade surplus with the UnitedStates will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,but would not automatically set off retaliation. Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief fromimports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered theadministration when he said any trade bill Reagan would signwould not be worth passage in Congress. But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate bysaying, ""I'm not trying to write legislation to please LaneKirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signedby the president."" Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a billto protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aidesaid. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.

Huckaby, a Louisiana Democrat and chairman of the Housesubcommittee which deals with the sugar program, indicated theeasing of the quota might be a way to calm the concern aboutthe impact of the severe cut in U.S. sugar imports this year. ""With imports coming down from 1.8 mln (last year) to onemln, there is legitimate concern about the impacts on Caribbeancountries and the Philippines,"" Huckaby said. By bringing forward to the third quarter some imports, thequota would effectively be eased by about 250,000 tons. Huckaby said by simply bringing forward to the thirdquarter of the year sugar imports scheduled for the Septemberto December period ""we could get away without having toincrease the quota."" He noted that some in the sugar industry believe anincrease in the quota is justified. Earlier this month, representatives of U.S. cane sugarrefiners met with U.S. Agriculture Department officials torequest a quota increase of at least 200,000 tons. The refinerssaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictivethere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S laterthis year, a refiner spokesman said. However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that itwould consider the request. Following the refiners' request, representatives of theFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express oppositionto any quota expansion, industry sources said. The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from asugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect ofthe current sugar program, indicates at least some growerofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of theimport quota, industry officials said. Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by theReagan administration's interagency sugar policy group. Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said""As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota yearis not under active consideration."" Reuter"

The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and optionsinvolving interest or exchange rates, complements proposalsagreed in January between the two central banks to makecommercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similarstandards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and bankshave until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. ""On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequatecapital support for potential future exposure -- on the otherhand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capitalrequirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. AndU.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.""  At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of theso-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of acurrency or interest rate contract and an estimate of itspotential change in value due to currency or interest ratefluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balancesheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one offive risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on thequality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of thecontract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, theplans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees wouldnot be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of riskweights.

Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped whenInternational Coffee Organization members failed to agree onhow coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, manyof the same experts gather in the same building here to try toagree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding theInternational Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock lossesrunning into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also castinga shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability tocompromise as governments do not want to be involved in pactswith built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clearlines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basicelements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement inGeneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International CocoaOrganization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied withquota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa tobe bought. One consumer country delegate said this would""distort, not support"" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCOfor destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffeeprices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts canfounder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoafutures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling hasalso contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the""must buy"" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,which came into force at the last ICCO session in January butwithout rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it shouldoperate and what discretion it should be given. The agreementlimits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says itcannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying orselling operations, were carried forward from the previousagreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy onall cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group onbuffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will beover non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock shouldpay when trading different types of cocoa. Another workinggroup is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrativematters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock fundsshould not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-membercountries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the bufferstock should buy it rather than compete with chocolatemanufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linkedto the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as acompromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that canrepresent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futuresmarket's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par ontothe London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse wouldoperate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell thehighest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside theEuropean Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with Francesiding with producers. EC representatives met in closed sessionin Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common groundand, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positionsamong the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs offlexibility on the part of producers in the next few days andwill be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer splitsaid consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less andbacks the concept of the pact which is ""meant to support themarket where trade buying is not."" In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell theircocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding includewhether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced""posted price"" as in the previous pact or by announcing it isbuying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted thatproducers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers ofcocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in away that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

The new accord is due to replace the current one, whichexpires in October. Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said theformal adoption represented ""a historic moment."" The latest round of talks, which began March 9, representedthe fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.Xuto described the negotiations as ""by no means easy, and weoften faced problems."" The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally whenratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world netexports and 75 pct of net imports. The new INRA will enter into force definitively whengovernments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and80 pct of net imports have ratified it. It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31this year. It is expected that provisional entry into force will takeat least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said. During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stockoperations will be suspended, but the International NaturalRubber Council will remain in place. Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and itssuccessor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers andconsumers of natural rubber over the long term. Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xutoadded. He also praised ""the spirit of 'give' and 'take' thatprevailed throughout this session."" Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutualityof interests between producers and consumers is now as valid asit was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the1970s. Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basisof predictable stable prices is ""a vital consideration formultinational tire companies, whether or not consumingcountries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriouslyconcerned about security of the rubber supply."" He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement hadserved the purpose for which it was created. Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accessionto the new pact ""to avoid an undue gap between the old and thenew. Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well. But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumershad been led to make proposals for improving its functioning. He added that the adoption of the new agreement ""attests tothe importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry."" Reuter"

Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe,as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair tradepractices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficitwith Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanesetrade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of actingwith the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. ""The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is theU.S.,"" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade PolicyResearch Centre in London. ""Basically, their policies are prettymuch the same."" But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Orthat the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage ofthe U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. ""In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,"" headded. ""In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic offree competition, while in Europe, the general approach is thatliberal trade is good because it makes countries rich."" Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington'stendency to impose so-called ""countervailing duties"" - an importtax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends tobe to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan hasthreatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronicgoods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan hasfailed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement asa violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. ""It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side ofthe United States in defence of the agreement,"" said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a toughline on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the restof Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC takethe lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels toldReuters there has been no change in the Community's positionsince a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent astrong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreignministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance andappealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said afterthe talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw nosigns of any immediate intention to impose any broad-rangingsanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking atrade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas inEuropean trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking totry to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over thedifficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless hasfaced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials saidlast week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, ""We are nottalking about days or weeks. This is going to take time."" They said the government would consider its options at acabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisionswere expected. The main thing the British would threaten theJapan with is denial of access to London's booming financialmarkets, government officials said. REUTER"

USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures willlikely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. cornproduction will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987corn production could drop by over one billion bushels toaround seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grainsprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservationprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrainanalysts said. ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease incorn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to notgo along with the program this year."" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year butat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, theysaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres. If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then thedrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 whenfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. Asevere drought that summer in major producing states causedyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analystssaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billionbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels. ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significantreduction in production,"" an analyst said. A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would notincrease significantly, a specialist said. High producing corn belt states are expected to show thegreatest acreage reductions, based upon historicalparticipation in government programs, analysts said. In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the mostin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the westerncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said. ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,""he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts inhigher-producing delta areas. Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said. U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, hassteadily declined in the 1980's. U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been inthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. Thehighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA haskept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mlnacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre. Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yieldsaveraging 119.3 bushels per acre. ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billionbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said. Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres aslong as government program provisions remain the same, analystssaid. Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required toset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligiblefor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15pct of their acreage.

They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may sheda further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in ratesafter yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stgreduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billionstg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the keythree-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the startof business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling ralliedto four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, withgains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paperbelow nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to haveplacated markets for now, analysts said. Money market ratesrecovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterlingand gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, andthe reappraisal of sterling assets by international investorswas set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher giltprices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. ""Today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. ""TheBank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temperthe markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."" Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cashto U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped tomaintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on howsterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initiallythrough Bank of England intervention but eventually the gainswould force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. ""The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for thetime being,"" said Midland Bank treasury economist DavidSimmonds. ""But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to holdup rates for long."" Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Centsthis week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase ManhattanSecurities, said ""There is another half point to come in thenear term, this week or next week at the latest...We see awhole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."" Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain hadvery little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchangerate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect ofa sterling rise on consumer price inflation would notmaterialise for at least nine months while its hampering impacton manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as wellas cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chancesof re-election for the Conservative government and probablyadvanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, thiswas likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominatedassets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficialtargets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favourbecause of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase'sMarshall said ""Sterling is simply the best game in town,especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.""

Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated tothe Hk Hotels board. A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family hasnot considered any countermoves so far.

Some of the slowness experienced in the October-Decemberperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarterthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect inJanuary slowed business and consumer spending. But some of the latest economic data show signs ofsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although someeconomists remain cautious about the outlook. The Commerce Department reported today that new orders fordurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pctrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defensegoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agencysaid. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of manyfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat toincreases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest theGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth forthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, aneconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farmjobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain inJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate ofabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuildingtheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in thesecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in thesecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumptionand government spending. He also sees residential constructiondeclining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of thefourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in thefirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter andshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in theU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline inthe dollar's value over the last year and half. ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levypredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but atleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as theprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,which soared to record levels last year, will improve this yearand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for theyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate theirdomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of thepressure off the United States whose five years of economicgrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market fortheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed toservice their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at amodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalancebetween the volume of goods imported to the United States andthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume ofexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the factthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsenedduring the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporateprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, thegovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measuredby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing amoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a keyelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct inFebruary, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that themanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elementsof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, theFed said that economic activity in the various regions of thecountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in mostregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said thepick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to thedrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a majorpick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economywill slip into recession either. He said higher prices on imported products and wage cutsthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeezeconsumers purchasing power. ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number ofyears,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering arounda modest two pct level for the next few years. Reuter"

But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committeedebate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt tomandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. bycountries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exactform of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the Houseapproved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cutby those countries.

Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms dueto a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relativeto gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. InMarch the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67. The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver ismodest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added. The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely tocontinue in the short term. A period of consolidation might be necessary before pricesattempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long asthe dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silverwas positive. However silver was less likely to continue to outpace theother metals by such a margin, Montagu said. REUTER

The company said that this was despite the mark's furtherstrengthening against the dollar and other currencies anddespite an increase in competitive pressure. ""The further progress of our business will depend largely onthe extent to which threats to free trade materialise and onthe developments of exchange rates, raw material and energycosts. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billionmarks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication ofthe likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declinedslightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showeda further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainlythe sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also broughtpressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against1985, the company said without giving details. ""The western Europe, North America and Far East regionsdeveloped well in local currency, but here too the translationof local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,especially in the case of North America,"" it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combinedwith savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offsetfalling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lowerextraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating rawmaterials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that worldgroup turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last threemonths of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pctto 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower andforeign turnover 8.6 pct lower.

""Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,""said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.""Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."" The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlrtakeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small butcash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last weekas Canadian Airlines International Ltd. Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about ninepct. Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive andcost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the truepotential of the former CP Air, which floundered for fourdecades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian PacificLtd. They said CP Air's management style had been not muchdifferent from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, becauseneither airline was held accountable to its owners. ""Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, thesetwo airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neitherseemed that concerned about the bottom line,"" said Bradley. ""But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be veryconscious of profitability and shareholder return. And AirCanada is on the verge of going that way,"" he said. CP Air, always fighting for market share rather thanprofits, was ""a perennial money-loser,"" analyst Wilfred Hahn ofBache Securities Inc said in a recent report. Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulatedlong-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, itslosses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs. Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later thisyear in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs onrevenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of morethan 2 billion dlrs. Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold tothe public, the prospect of privatization at a time ofincreased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay moreattention to finances, analysts said. It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit ""inexcess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs"" for 1986. However, this profitrecovery was due less to management skill than the fact thatall Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said. Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 inVancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors. For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct airtraffic growth, and they expect profits will come fromcost-cutting and careful spending. Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd saidinstitutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to theirportfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that newcompetition makes profit growth less certain. ""The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. Atone time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobodyelse's,"" Friend said. Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airlineshares for at least a year. Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of apublic stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routeswithout setting off a political storm. It also will be faced with an expensive but necessaryupdating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft. Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase ofa dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie. Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week orderedsix commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it wouldsoon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or theBoeing Co. Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these withouthurting profits. Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects CanadianAirlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western. Reuter"

Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pcttreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached. But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikelyto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely forfear of upsetting the current wage round. One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""Idon't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whateverhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all itwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."" In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the groundfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessmentsof growth and inflation, economists said. Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if theBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in themedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands. As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no movethat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said. In the current round, the country's most powerful union,the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, isdemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from thepresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages. The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, isoffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and givea two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 thisyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988. The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largestunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set thebenchmark for settlements in other industries such as thepublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiationsbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude byearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June. Though many economists said the unions' current warningstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy andwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-weekstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly ontheir positions and there could still be conflict. This could extend the length of time in which theBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said. The money market head said the unions' humiliation by theprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperativehousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy. ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put thissquarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said. In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metallunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined thanhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battleto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership. More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly insouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hoursyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH andaerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out inwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said. Money market dealers said that overnight call money rateswould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend ona politically-inhibited Bundesbank. About eight billion marks were coming into the markettomorrow from salary payments by the federal government. As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offerto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,anticipating still lower rates before the month-end. But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customerswas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short ofliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling. Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement. REUTER"

Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitivenessthis year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wageincrease, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered somecalls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government's response, the central bankwill stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which willalso see a key parliamentary debate on government finances andthe economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimatereflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutcheconomic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset thedecline in export growth caused by slowing growth in WestGermany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pctgrowth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and thegovernment has already admitted it will not meet its goal ofreducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned centralbank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and ifnecessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticisedthe guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark inlast January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment andexpressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economyhad become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of thedollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank's decision notto copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and insteadlower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the movesaying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact onthe money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at themoment not the most important Dutch rate because it is alreadyfar below the market rates."" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade ofthe Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interestrate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlandsrecently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being soldto take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark wouldreduce international confidence in the guilder and make it moredificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutchinterest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revaluedcompletely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decisionnot to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Piersonwarned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder. Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministryand the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding havingsaid before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lowerDutch rates but that the Germans should move first. One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates downto reduce the government debt burden. A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates wereneeded but denied any suggestion of conflicting views betweenthe ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy issteady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said. REUTER"

Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeksof negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) thatthere would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactionsand a fluctuating rate, decided by the auction, for other typesof business. The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions todistribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determinethe kwacha's exchange rate, but these were suspended at the endof January. President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he wassuspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluationand violent fluctations of the exchange rate which hadresulted. Business and banking sources said another reason forsuspending the auction was that the central bank was low onforeign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successfulbidders.

Their comments followed remarks by prime minister JacquesChirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministerswere agreed on the desirability of ""relaunching"" the economy. This sparked speculation the government was preparing for areflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruledout any such move. The sources today said the government's policy remained oneof ""recovery,"" or sound finances and greater efficiency. They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion francrevenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisationprogram will go to providing public companies with freshcapital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go towardpaying off national debt. Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30billion would be distributed between repayment of nationalinternal debt and public companies in similar proportions, theyadded. The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation whenthe country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct thisyear from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice asfast as gross domestic product. Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct thisyear from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line withearlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct. The sources said that with France's economic targets for1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, thegovernment had no intention of pushing the economy to grow atan artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands andDenmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats whichhas already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC ledby the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said. But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen toldjournalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree thetax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annualfarm price package, would leave a large hole in the group'sbudget. He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mindup for good. ""I hope the debate is still open, if not there willbe a formidable hole in the budget,"" he said. The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 andwould be only slightly less this year, he said. Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax aheadof farm ministers in a move described by diplomats asunprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministersrecognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy. The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extracash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levelsand to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption bymaking it more competitive with other oils. Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oilproducers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by thetax. ""What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be betterunderstood not just outside the community but at home,"" he said. Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in theEC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal toimpose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fatscould seriously damage the EC's trade relations with othercountries. Britain also warned that the tax could hit developingcountries already receiving aid from the EC, they said. The Commission also defended proposals to dismantleMonetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross bordersubsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuationsfor farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism. In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ECexecutive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clearsuch a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers. Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism atthe talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany hadbeen alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect ofthe Commission's farm price proposals, he added.   Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid theEC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portugueseopposition. The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes ofunwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning itinto animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices. National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out ofsavings from another plan to curb milk production. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by thescheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massivesurpluses built up before they joined the community last year,but the two countries did not block today's vote.

Finance Minister Robert Chien told reporters his ministryand the Central Bank would work jointly on new measures to easethe controls, but he did not give details. Yu said the government could maintain the framework of theforeign exchange controls while finding ways to ease them. Thecontrols would be used during emergency. Taiwan's reserves have resulted largely from its tradesurplus, which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billionin 1985. About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan's tradewith the United States, according to official figures. But he said that while easing the controls would helpreduce the reserves, it would not do so substantially in ashort time.

He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association(APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing apackage that would recognise the government's economicpriorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns. Evans was referring to a nearly completed government reviewof oil taxation. Evans said there were plenty of examples where targetedapproaches to oil industry taxation had produced good resultsin recent years. These include the reduction in the top marginal crudeexcise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshoreoil announced last September, he said. The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for theelimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boostincentives for prospecting against a background of weak pricesand Australia's relatively low exploration levels. ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity toan already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favourthese kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may stillleave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies aregoing to do in major areas,"" Evans said. He said the government did not intend to change itsresource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now beforeparliament, in response to industry calls to allow allexploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible. As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited tohighly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after acertain rate of return has been achieved for individualprojects. APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax becauseexploration deductibility is limited to successful projects. Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based morethan anything on the government's desire to ensure thecertainty and stability of the new regime, adding that majorinvestments have already been planned on the existing groundrules.

Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annualassembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales haddropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from lastyear's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact onVenezuela."" PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, ofwhich 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refinedproducts. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpdand the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was notenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average pricefrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higherthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accountingsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refiningand marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keepgasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrelsin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance ofVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country'sproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, ofwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.  Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in theworld, Hernandez said. Reuter"

The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes. The study noted that the effects of last year's lowerprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, whichwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago. However, the study said that primary production, likely toreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls. Around a third of silver production comes from heavilyindebted Mexico and Peru. Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that themajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce thecash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which adealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider thannormal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by makingit worthwhile for farmers to move grain. By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDAcould encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under thegovernment price support loan program and then marketed. If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movementwould break the Gulf corn basis. ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine countyposted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking theaverage of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" whichwould more closely reflect the lower prices in the interiorMidwest. ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealersaid, which has created uncertainty in the market. The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effortto free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited tothe government and remain off the market and in storage. Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightlymore than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificatesit has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to datebeen exchanged for grain. With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIKcertificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, theUSDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grainby adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said. A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise inbarge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwestto the export terminals, cash dealers said. Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risennearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of theoriginal tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening ofthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged thefirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted. The higher transportation costs have served to depressinterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained bythe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well asdiscouraging farmer marketings, they said. ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,""which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as muchas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain tradersaid. But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,freight rates will settle back down because of the overallsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system. Reuter"

The company's board held a regularlyscheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Managementannouncement. She said a statement was expected but it was notcertain when it would be ready.  She was unable to say if there had been any prior contactbetween Waste Management and ChemLawn officials. ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company thatdoesn't like a surprise attack would."" Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tenderoffers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawncould try to find a white knight if does not want to beacquired by Waste Management. Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder saidServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> wereexamples of companies that could be interested. ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides andherbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal ofwastes. Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable toanother company that wants to capitalize on a strongresidential and commercial distribution system. Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates hadcatapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 butthe stock languished as the rate of growth slowed. Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in thefourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share forthe full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter. Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands ofindividual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice. Reuter"

It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreignunfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs andallow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed byU.S. actions against other countries. The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to winrelief from surges of imports of competitive products.

He told a news conference here ""After due consultation withmy colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeriaand all member countries of OPEC remain determined to upholdthe December agreement by adhering strictly to their variousquotas and official selling prices."" Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleadingnews in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC membercountries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in themonth of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firmdetermination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrsagreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling forOPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixedprices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord butfell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing morethan the agreed level. ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would nothold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases ofOPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukmansaid. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was basedon the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, addingthat Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,while the production figures of Ecuador and the United ArabEmirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreementsucceed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price levelof 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meetingformerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference isat the moment contemplated since most agreements reached inDecember are being adhered to,"" he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrowthe gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed inrelation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We considerthe defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."" Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawnon stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels wellbelow this time last year and soon they would return to themarket in search of crude. ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty inmaintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which hesaid had contributed to the group's efforts to stabiliseprices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-heldview not to do anything to help the market. ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term withtwo-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future isours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's outputfollowing an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if theSouth American country would be allowed a higher output quotawhen it recovered from the disaster.

Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumernations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten anoversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister DenisBra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually beobliged to restore their positions.

Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day inLondon down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, thelowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs(1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned byIvory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if theslide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoaproducer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead anAfrican initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end ofnext month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-basedInter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf ofthe continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. ""An initiative from IACO is likely very soon,"" he saidwithout elaborating. ""Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarkedon a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragilemarket,"" he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said PresidentFelix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that hisgovernment would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteedby the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that thecoffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents)per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversifyits agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent fromworld market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonightsaid that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteranIvorian leader reaffirmed ""his faith in Ivory Coast's bright(economic) future"" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the governmentdecided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mlndlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one ofAfrica's showpiece economies, is going through difficult timesfollowing the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa andcoffee.

Beef producers are becoming more confident that higherreturns in the market, both domestically and overseas, willcontinue, the AMLC said. The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production isexpected to bring about a slight drop in both export anddomestic consumption this year, it said. The forecast does not assume a turnaround in productionlevels until late next year. It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion ofoutput remains much the same as last year when it was around 55pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct. The increase in exports of beef as a percentage ofproduction has mainly been attributed to the decline in theAustralian dollar, the AMLC said. It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, theU.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate thechilled and frozen beef export markets.

Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on theuse of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 couldresult in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs. However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in netsavings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said. Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly theentire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have beenforfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC. In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have beenredeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges wouldhave remained in the goverment inventory, he said. When asked to comment on a recent study by the GeneralAccounting Office that concluded certificates result in a netcost to the government, Amstutz said, ""GAO underestimated thebenefits and overstated the costs"" of the certificate program. Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loanentries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions ratherthan forfeitures. GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said. ""There is no question in the mind of the Department ofAgriculture that these certificates have been very useful,""Amstutz said. Immediate benefits of certificates include greater marketliquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farmincome, and improved debt situation and decreased carryingcosts, he said.

The stock consolidation ""is something we're discussing, butit's not definite,"" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattnertold Reuters in an interview. A private placement recently brought the number ofoutstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July31, 1986, the fiscal yearend. ""The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,""Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to applyfor listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange. Shattner said the company expects to report a profit offive pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the thirdquarter should be about the same as the second, he added. Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195dlrs in the second quarter. After ""a disastrous first quarter,"" Sand hopes to break evenin the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company hasscaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the33.5 mln dlrs projected in December. The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. andCanadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs. In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585dlrs. Shattner believes the company will post better results thisyear due to several factors. ""Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buyingproducts in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachiin U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in thesecond quarter,"" he said. Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computeraccessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancementdevices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> ofJapan. Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,is developing software that lets large maniframe computershandle large databases and share them between applications. It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, whichis artificial intelligence computer language for use by majorcorporations. The company has also reduced costs through some staffcutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staffinstead of straight commissions, Shattner said. And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourthfiscal quarter, Shattner said. Reuter"

Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheatmarkets since officials from the two countries held theircustomary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow'sdecision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn marketstrengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects. Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13. Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand inthe way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export EnhancementProgram, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit toMoscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representativeshere as a clear signal that the Reagan administration waspreparing an offer. Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lippedabout the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned thecontention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility. Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whomasked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that anoffer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as topredict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten daysto two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaderswho had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancementoffer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would endup being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier thisyear when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrsper tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheatsubsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases ofU.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat dealwould appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial stepof offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but wereembarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the groundsthat the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat pricesfar above world market prices. The administration's decision to set the subsidy level upfront instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be ameans of controlling the price while attempting to dampencriticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultzfrom saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington wasoffering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available toU.S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representativeshere is that a general warming of relations between the twocountries since last summer, combined with continued hard timesin the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would considerbuying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively. However, observers have not forgotten the circumstancessurrounding the administration's announcement of the wheatsubsidy offer last summer. Up until the time of the announcment, congressional andindustry leaders were led to believe the White House haddecided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include notonly the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries. Instead, the administration scaled back the offer toinclude only the Soviets. That last-minute change of heart adds a measure ofuncertainty even to the predictions of those most convincedthat the administration will not now pass up the opportunity tosell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week thatpayment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who askednot to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, sayingit did not take into account storage, handling and transportsavings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided tore-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budgetcommittees are known to be considering limiting the use ofcertificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO SeniorAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before theSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there areuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates comparedto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 centsto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put ingovernment storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigativearm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs thegovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farmprice and income support programs, Reagan administrationsources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use ofpayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tightstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have beensold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate DirectorBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committeesintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federalbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use ofPIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, orcerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays tofarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used torepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities orcash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billiondlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January andAugust 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarilybecause recipients can use the certificates to pay backgovernment loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would savethe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according tothe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, accordingto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificatescost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to beconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among othersavings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that theestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to datehave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mlndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, oneadministration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimatesbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributableto the different effect certificates can have on market pricesover the course of a crop year. USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has foundthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels ofcorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn bybetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates hadonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERSstudy, obtained by Reuters. Reuter"

The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals toimplement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even thatscaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains shouldbe treated equally, they said.   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, thensupporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably notoffer their proposals next week, sources said.   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. CharlesStenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, butwhether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's firstchoice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheatfarmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aidfor winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because ofcontroversy over spring wheat, then English might consider aneven greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and stillreceive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill toinclude a 0/92 program for feedgrains. An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farmbill, but to be fair to all crops. Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers wouldlikely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant aregreater than to idle the land, economists said. Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it ispremature to make major changes in the farm bill and that theHouse Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely theimpacts of such a program.

The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiencypayments and paid land diversion payments in a two-thirdcertificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told aHouse agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughlya 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possiblescenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a ""zerocertificate case,"" where no certificate program was assumed,and an alternative case labeled ""adequate certificate case"" inwhich sufficient certificates would be released so that grainprices would not be artificially supported by market shortagesdue to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequatecertificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenarioby 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grainusage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed thezero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expendituresunder the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case. The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct ofthose savings resulted from smaller government storage costs. The study also estimated that government grain stocks underthe adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushelsbelow the zero certificate case at the end of the periodexamined. The Sparks study said that while certificates permit marketprices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increasecommodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versuscash. Reuter"

The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expectedto make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient,he said. ""The contracts wil accelerate the process and reducethe expense of swap documentation,"" Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct ofall new issues eventually become part of either an interestrate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usuallyacting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other'sinterest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of afloating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and viceversa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remainswith the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use ofswaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on someportion of the risk but is not required to show it on thebalance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficientcapital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and presidentof Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank ofEngland and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected latertoday to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capitalstandards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announcedconvergence agreement between the two countries in whichregulators have attempted to set similar capital requirementsfor institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a""level playing field"" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold moreprimary capital against swap transactions than is the currentpractice, the additional costs would have to be passed on toissuers. The issuers might then choose to do business withlower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Bankingrules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct forswap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks, hesaid. REUTER"

Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender themarket sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonneswere granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely tosatisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition forsupplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm. The release of the feed wheat followed recent strongrepresentations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage ininterior markets. The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at theApril 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May andJune. News of the release produced an early downward reaction inlocal physical markets, but by midday some sections had halvedearly two stg losses while others were unchanged. Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mlntonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in thefree market. However, some traders believe these figures areoverstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, thebulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also offthe market in futures stores. A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has beensold for export or to the home market since the season startedJuly 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mlntonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said. This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed allearly expectations and has created the present nervoussituation in domestic markets where the fear now is free marketsupplies may not last out until new crop becomes available inAugust. The market is sticking to its recent prediction of totalbarley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a newrecord and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnesachieved in the 1984/85 season. Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln andbarley around 4.50 mln tonnes. The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mlntonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traderssaid. Other EC countries have bought large amounts of Britishgrain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mlntonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley.

""The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --but set in their context of structural reforms, they areexcellent,"" Develle said. But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chiefarchitect of the government's free market policies, may bepursuing a mirage. ""The belief that economic liberalism will produce anexplosion of economic forces is ideological"" said Indosuez chiefeconomist Jean Cheval. ""Personally I think it's an illusion.Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."" Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controlshave been largely abolished, labour regulations have beenpruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugelypopular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banksand industries to private investors. Since December, nearly five mln French investors havebought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas &lt;PARI.PA> and glassmaker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA &lt;SGEP.PA>, the first two statecompanies brought to the stock market under the 300 billionfranc five-year privatisation plan. Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports ofcapital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money hasflooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to liftthe market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct sinceDecember. At the end of last year the government abolished pricecontrols that had existed for 42 years on services such as carrepairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention smallbusinesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy. The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer pricesin January, partly responsible for a forced revision in theofficial 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct orless. ""But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when youconsider that prices are now free for the first time since1945,"" commented Develle of Paribas. Other achievements include a major reduction in the state'sforeign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target anddown from 153.3 billion in 1985. But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and agradual improvement in industrial productivity, the Frenchfranc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliatingthree pct devaluation against the West German mark, its secondsince Chirac took power. A recent report by the Organisation for EconomicCooperation and Development pilloried French industry forfailing to produce the goods that its potential customerswanted. Outside the mainly state-controlled high technologysectors, French industrial goods were ""increasingly ill-adaptedto demand"" and over-priced, the report said. French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreedwith the report. ""One of the assumptions of the government isthat if you give them freedom, the employers will invest andmodernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they likefreedom, and then wait to be told which way to go,"" he said. And despite rising industrial investment and theintroduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier. The problem for the government is that there may be littlemore it can do to prod the economy into faster growth. French producers failed more than most to take advantage oflast year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on theshaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries likeWest Germany and Japan, they say.

USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, thatwould offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in thecultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishablecommodities. The department is considering including in its definitionof perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,the New York Times reported yesterday. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see thedefinition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of whichis ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,""Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said. Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbyingUSDA hard to have their products covered by the amnestyprovision, farm industry sources said. Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation saidlivestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they willbe unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joinedthat industry. A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congressdid not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workerswho helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops andSpanish reeds was ""marginal."" In addition, lawmakers made it clear during considerationof the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by thethe amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees""a tough call,"" this source said. USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulationexcept to say it was subject to change before it will bereleased, probably some time later this month. While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule underconsideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress isnot likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigrationquestion, congressional sources said. The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workerswas crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill. Congressional staff members estimate the special farmworker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers whoworked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to applyfor temporary, then permanent, resident status. Reuter"

They said foreign exchange constraints and national policywould not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peakedat 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government putmaximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poorharvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. ""China is short of foreign exchange,"" the Shanghai officialsaid. ""We cannot rely on imports, even at current low worldprices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become amajor importer."" A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain importswould rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,low world prices and rising domestic demand for human andanimal consumption. ""At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grainit exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badlyneeds,"" the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought isaffecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reducethe summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not payingenough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making itdifficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mlntonnes against 391 mln in 1986. ""All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvestarea, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice andhigh-yield cash crops,"" it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced toprovide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fightthe drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention tograin, stressing that growth in output is vital to China'seconomic and political stability and that prices paid tofarmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grainproduction is a key state policy and outlined the measuresbeing taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct ofthe pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidiseagriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also setaside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outsideShanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and threeyears unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department ofZhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grainoutput in his province. ""In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,raising the level of science and technology on the farms andimproving the supply of raw materials, roads and otherinfrastructure,"" he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work inindustry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in theirspare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output shouldreach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be madeprofitable. ""The advantages the state promises grain growers actuallyyield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off byintermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.Only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said.

Jiang Feng Xiang said the port -- the deepest in China --handled 17.95 mln tonnes of cargo last year, up from 10.44 mlnin 1985, but well below its potential capacity of 32 mlntonnes. Shanghai handled 100 mln tonnes of cargo in 1986. Jiang said Ningbo is under-utilised because of itsinadequate facilities, including a single track rail linelinking it to Hangzhou, where it joins the national network. Ningbo handles crude oil exports and transhipments of coalfrom north to south China and imports include fertiliser andsoda ash and iron ore from Brazil and Australia. The docks canhandle ships of up to 150,000 tonnes and oil tankers of up to200,000 tonnes can load and unload in the harbour. Most of Ningbo's port infrastructure has been built since1979, official publications show. A container berth and twotimber and three general cargo berths will be added during thecurrent 1986-90 five-year plan, Jiang said. ""The rail line to Hangzhou will be double tracked by 1995.By 2000, maybe, we will overtake Shanghai,"" he added. REUTER"

Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducingboth price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWCsays in a survey of support prices in the five main wheatexporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S. In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for exportincome, there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead tounemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could thenlead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open togovernments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that whenthe world economy improves demand for wheat will rise andsurpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat whichcould be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a longperiod. This option may prove to be the most politicallyunattractive and would result in many producers abandoningwheat production, the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguishbetween the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,possibly varying support prices according to farm size oroverall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exportingcountries since 1982. At some time during that period all theproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower exportsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations morethan offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC interventionprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 Europeancurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in whichmost export transactions are denominated, the interventionprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost ofsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequersand some governments are now searching for ways to cutexpenditure, the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the fivemajor exporters declined in the period covered by the surveyfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due toincreased production in China and India. The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this wascountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by loweracreages. In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 percent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch toother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750mln barrels, from its present 500 mln, to help protect theeconomy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise. The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, a privategroup, also called for new research for oil exploration anddevelopment techniques. It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs abarrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s, withimports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption. The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation: toprotect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other suchdevice or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil. But the group did not strongly back either option, sayingthere were benefits and drawbacks to both. It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reservesand more exploration and development research would help toguard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports. Reuter

At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set aseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.

At a telephone conference on February 23, committee membersdiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached inParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. Noconclusions were contained in the minutes. In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMCsaid that ""somewhat greater reserve restraint would, orslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptabledepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking intoaccount the strength of the business expansion, developments inforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, andconditions in domestic and international credit markets."" The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchangedpolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank presidentfavored some tightening of reserve conditions. He noted the strong growth in bank loans in Novemberthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that hadprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. Healso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value. Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potentialfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believedthat prompt restraints might avert the need for moresubstantial tightening later. Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMCminutes showed, ""the members generally felt that policyimplementation should be especially alert to the potential needfor some firming of reserve conditions."" In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserverestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow inline with current expectations and there were concurrentindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against thebackground of stronger economic data. One indication of potential price pressure might be afurther tendency for the dollar to weaken. The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easingduring the weeks ahead. However, ""most of the members did notwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing duringthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view theconditions for such a move as likely to emerge."" The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in thedollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have anysignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections. Inaddition, they anticipated that considerable progress would bemade in reducing the federal budget deficit. Reuter"

Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding buttold journalists the consensus covers the principles involvedin agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done toimprove the global situation in agriculture. Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally todiscuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launchedin Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September. Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the sameroad...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations isanother matter entirely."" There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal withthe problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how weare going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said. However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple ofyears of tough negotiations ahead, he said. ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to ploughimmense amounts of financial resources into the production ofitems that nobody wants to buy,"" he said. He said the long-term answer is to switch some of thefinancial resources now committed to agriculture to other moreproductive areas. This would help agriculture because some itsinefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, hesaid. Individual segments in many countries may lose in theprocess, but it should result in a more rational system ofworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said. It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach arelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably morethan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,he said. Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture inthe negotiations, he said ""one has to be politicallyrealistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agriculturaltrade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have tobe as part of a larger package."" REUTER"

Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation ofCopperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed inthe state-owned copper mines, union officials said. Other members of the MDP, which includes the communistparty and a faction of the socialist party, took five of theprincipal positions on the union's directorate. The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) producesaround 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mlntonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporterand sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income. The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union'sdirectorate in elections earlier this month, with the christiandemocratic party holding five and the remainder being won byindependents. But the left-wing was left in control of the union afterthe christian democrats and independents failed to reachagreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrewfrom negotiations. Union elections were called following the resignation offormer president Rodolfo Seguel last October. Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known unionleader, said he was forced to step down after repeated courtactions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating. The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union nationalworkers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCOfollowing a strike in 1983. The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in thepast 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests againstthe military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.  CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as unionleader when no longer employed by the company. Reuter

The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economicoutlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected togrow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984. Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increasefrom last year's 423.95 billion. The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value ofthe guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pctlast year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an averageof 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986. ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unitlabour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, whilethese are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said. More of economic growth now depended on domesticconsumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins setby domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect onpurchasing power of lower import costs and deflation. Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, theCPB said. Inflation was zero last year. Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by fivepct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth lastyear, the CPB said. Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue tocondition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recentyears, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact ofthese factors on Dutch competitiveness. In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and socialsecurity costs to employers. The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring downthe deficit and reduce tax and social security payments infuture. Dutch government revenue is being depressed further byfalling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said. It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 thisyear from 710,000 last year. While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB iswithin its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to twopct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates. Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said inits February economic outlook that GDP growth at constantprices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analystshad expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its ownlatest estimate. ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the wholedocument yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in someof our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said. The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energyexports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said. Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared withfour pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said. The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in thesurplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1billion last year, the CPB forecast. REUTER"

Key wheatgrowing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasusreceived on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said. The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke recordlows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken itstoll on Soviet winter crops, she said. However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt hadample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majorityof crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grainsin the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily fromCanada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia,Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible cropproblems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing onmoisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weathernecessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobylaccident may have contaminated more grain than originallythought and have to be made up with imports. However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of lastresort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have onlyjust recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to theUSSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grainimports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Unionbought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only24 pct of that total. While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised theirestimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said. Reuter"

Because much of the crude oil in California fields isthick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have toincrease to near 1985's levels before any significant recoveryis seen in drilling, they said. ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled. Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, comparedto about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger OilInformation Services, which tracks California drillingactivity. ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state'sdrilling activity. Current prices are not enough to justify increaseddrilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California IndependentProducers Association. While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pactto curb production boosted oil prices early this year, priceseventually fell. Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, haveslumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a highof about 17 dlrs. More than half of California's oil comes from stripperwells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and thatmuch of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel toextract, Malmgreen said. ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""Malmgreen said. Many stripper wells along the southern California coastproduce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inlandwells frequently require the use of steam injection to spurextraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said. The outlook for future production in California is cloudedby a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said. In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, whichproduces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratorydrilling has slowed to a crawl. Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell ofthe state energy commission. So far this year only fiveexploratory wells have been drilled. ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did lastyear,"" Mitchell said. No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest ofthe decade, Mitchell said. Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in thenumber of producing wells and overall production. Between February and October of 1986, the number ofproducing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 frommore than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California EnergyCommission. In line with that decrease, California's crude oil outputfell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and isexpected to remain at that lower level, analysts said. Between February and October 1986, California's crude oilproduction slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrelsper day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said. Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department ofConservation. ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""Guerard said. Reuter"

December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since thegovernment's Management and Coordination Agency began compilingstatistics under its current system in 1953. ""There is a general fear that we will become a country withhigh unemployment,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist forthe Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. The government, which published the January unemploymentfigures today, did not make any predictions. ""At present we do not have a forecast for the unemploymentrate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situationimproving,"" a Labour Ministry official said. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government hadexpected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conferencethe record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budgetwhich has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms. The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steeland shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employeesand ceased hiring, economists said. Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed agreat number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo BankLtd's economics department. However, other economists disagreed, saying the servicesector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by themanufacturing sector over the next five years. The economists said the service sector should grow as thegovernment stimulates domestic demand under its program totransform the economy away from exports. Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower thanthose of other industrialised nations, methods for calculatingstatistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned. ""The three pct figure  could translate into a relativelyhigh figure if European methods were used,"" one economist said.More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from ayear earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo'sTsukihara said.

Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc toldclients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. Theanalyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.

Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade roundlaunched by ministers last September. The round, which covers13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods andservices will take four years to negotiate. Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financialinstitutions such as the International Monetary Fund and WorldBank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers toensure the success of the Uruguay Round. ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened toassure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of theworld trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said. ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy."" He also also urged that member states be accountable toeach other for their trade policies. Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with EuropeanCommunity (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted tostress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics. ""We are interested in more periodic ministerialinvolvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said. GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord onsemiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT traderules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanesechips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT disputepanel be set up to review the agreement.

Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.Banks, steel and other businesses. In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan'sbiggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;FairchildSemiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which suppliescomponents for supercomputers. Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities CoLtd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seekinga niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while thecountry's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseasbanking, the takeover specialists said. Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporatingin the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, allhave foreign businesses on their shopping lists. Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the mostpressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big automakers they subcontract for as these move offshore. ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy uppotential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" atakeover specialist at one trading company said. Japanese companies have become among the world's richestafter a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbedagainst the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months. But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs ofJapan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move intoits traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,the specialists said. Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect morebarriers against Japanese exports. Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoidthe gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer littleinvestment opportunity. ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, butthe recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said abanking industry source. So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious. While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number inthe thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies havetotalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said. Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japaneseacquisition activity was originally expected five years fromnow, but that time span appeared now to be too long. Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said. A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and ChemicalsInc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, headded. Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bidfor the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entirebusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate allbut its graphic arts-related businesses. Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned uponby the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanesepeople don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicabledeals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanesecompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This isa healthy progression."" However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run theboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns. ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing alarge U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They willexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way forJapanese business."" A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not manymega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the bigdeals there have already been done."" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets ofJapanese companies, the specialists said. Japanese will be aiming for new businesses inhigh-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technologyand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviatefrom that trend,"" one takeover specialist said. Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. Ifthese succeed, activity could build, the specialists said. But few such specialists are going to sit back and waituntil the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese tradinghouses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages andforeign merchant banks have set up research sections to act asgo-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups andwidespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will behard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S.President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincidedwith news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surpluslast month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration'sEconomic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory actionagainst Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a jointtrade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - onedesigned to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in theshort-term, the other to redirect the country in the mediumterm away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting couldrob both packages of much of their punch and might even preventone from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw upa package of short-term economic measures until after its1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that wouldamount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time forhis trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott byopposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to theU.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his rulingLiberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its ownmeasures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basisof the government's plans, without losing face in parliamentover the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economicpackage said it would probably include interest rate cuts onloans by government corporations, deregulation, measures topass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers inthe form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned forthe entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the firsthalf, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfyReagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S.Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American tradedeficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is alsolikely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-termeconomic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japangovernor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a finalreport outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy daysbefore Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up toMaekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and arelikely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas asagricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailedas possible, they said the political realities might force themto water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economymight look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoesmassive restructuring, officials said. The subcommitteeprojects that the current account surplus will fall to lessthan two pct of Japan's total output, or gross nationalproduct, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, whichmeasures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pctof gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth forJapan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradualappreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around1993, from 150 now.

""That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATTround,"" he said.

The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Puntadel Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and serviceswere included in the negotiations for the first time.

The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increasesince a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. Itattributed last month's rise to several factors, includingsubsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises. The department said personal consumption expenditures wereup during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct inJanuary.

Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in Februaryafter declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both lastmonth's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was becauseof government subsidy payments, the department said. Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs inFebruary following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from amonth earlier but that was offset by declines in federalnonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.
