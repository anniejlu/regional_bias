As previously reported, the region has been undergoing asevere dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, sinceDecember, following the virtual failure of the summer wetseason. Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops arebeginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growthsince the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane. Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much betterthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesmansaid. But is too early to say what they will be and more rainis needed to restore sub-soil moisture. Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg regionand southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition andsome mills are forecasting record crops, he said. Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiledtowards the end of May, he said. The cane crush normally runs from June to December. REUTER

""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets,"" he said in a statement. Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available. If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production,"" Condon said. ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry,"" he added.

ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposedbid. The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days. Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller. He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture. The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR. CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option. ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment. ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said. ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said. CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago. Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target."" Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals. Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April. The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval. Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares. ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price. Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands. ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of&lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL. Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid. REUTER"
